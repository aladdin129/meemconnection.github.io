to Allah Who has taken His servant by night from the Sacred Mosque
(Mecca) to the Farthest Mosque (Jerusalem).&quot;</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">33:56: &quot;Allah and

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">53: 1-18: &quot;By the
star when it sets, Your companion does not err, nor is he deceived:Nor
does he speak of his own desire. It is nothing except an inspiration
that is inspired, which one of mighty powers has taught him, one
vigorous; and he grew clear to view when he was on the uppermost
horizon. Then he drew near and came down till he was at a distance
of two bow lengths or even nearer, And He revealed to His slave
that which He revealed. The heart did not lie in seeing what it
saw. Will you then dispute with him concerning what he sees? And
truely he saw him yet another time by the furthest-tree of the
furthest boundary, near which is the Garden of Abode. When that
which shrouds did enshroud the furthest-tree, The eye did not
turn aside nor yet was it overbold. Truely he saw one of the greater
revelations of his Rabb (Lord).</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Allah ordered Jibraeel to
go down with seventy thousand angels to Muhammad (pbuh), and stand
by his door. &quot;Accompany him to My presence. And you, Mikaeel,
take the hidden knowledge and go down with seventy thousand angels
and stand by the door of his bedroom. You, Israfeel, and you Azraeel,
do as Jibraeel and Mikaeel have been ordered.&quot; Then He said
to Jibraeel: &quot;Increase the light of the moon with the light
of the sun, and increase the light of the stars with the light
of the moon.&quot; Jibraeel asked: &quot;Allah, has the Day of
resurrection dawned?&quot; Allah said: &quot;No, but tonight We
are calling to Our presence Muhammad (pbuh), the last Messenger
who came after Isa (Jesus) to reveal to him a secret that pertains
to Us.&quot; Jibraeel said: &quot;Allah, what is that secret?&quot;
Allah said: &quot;Jibraeel! The secret of kings cannot be given
to the servants. Go with My order and don't ask.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">And Jibraeel began his descent
carrying with him the heavenly message. All the angels accompanied
him as Allah had ordered, until they reached the door of Muhammad
(pbuh). When they arrived, they said: <I>&quot;Qum ya sayyidi</I>:
Arise, my Master, and prepare yourself! Ride on the back of the
<I>buraq</I>, the heavenly creature that will carry you on your
journey to the Rabb (Lord) of power through the land of the angels!&quot;</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">THE BURAQ (HEAVENLY
BEAST)</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">When Allah ordered Jibraeel
to carry with him the buraq for Muhammad (pbuh) to ride, he went
to the paradise of buraqs and there he found forty million buraqs.
Every buraq had a crown on its forehead inscribed with the words:
&quot;There is no god only Allah, Muhammad is the Messenger of
Allah.&quot; Under it was written: &quot;Believe in Me, in My
angels, in My books, and in My Rasools (prophets).&quot; Jibraeel
saw among them a buraq who secluded himself and who sat alone
crying. Jibraeel came to him and asked him why he was in such
a state. The buraq answered: &quot;I heard the name of Muhammad
(pbuh) forty thousand years ago, and my yearning for him has prevented
me from eating and drinking.&quot; Jibraeel chose that buraq and
he took him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">The buraq had the body of
a horse but the face of a human being, with big black eyes and
soft ears. His colour was that of a peacock whose plumage was
set with red rubies and corals, on which sat a white head of musk
on a neck of amber. His ears and shoulders were of pure white
pearls attached with golden chains, each chain decorated with
glittering jewels. His saddle was made of silk lined with silver
and gold threads. His back was covered with green emerald and
his halter was pure peridot.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">The speed of the buraq is
according to his sight. His legs reach wherever his eyes can see.
Jibraeel said: &quot;Rasool Allah, this night is your night, and
your turn has come to shine in the sky of creation. You are the
sun of ancient and recent knowledge, you are the moonlight of
the beauties of the worlds, the happiness of creation and the
adornment of the lands of human beings and angels. You are the
cup of love from the river of milk and honey. The river of Kawser
in paradise overflows in anticipation of seeing you. You, the
joy of all creation, the pride of paradise, the tables are ready
and the palaces of heaven are waiting for your coming!&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">&quot;Jibraeel,&quot; said
Muhammad (pbuh), &quot;did you come with a message of mercy or
wrath?&quot;<BR>
&quot;I came with a message from your Rabb (Lord) to give you
a secret.&quot;<BR>
&quot;What does the Rabb (Lord) of Generosity want to do with
me?&quot;<BR>
&quot;He wants to shower you with His mercy and all human beings
that accept you.&quot;<BR>
&quot;Give me a moment to prepare myself.&quot;<BR>
&quot;I brought you water of paradise and a turban with a message
inscribed: 'Muhammad the servant of Allah; Muhammad the prophet
of Allah; Muhammad the beloved of Allah; Muhammad the friend of
Allah.'&quot;<BR>
&quot;Jibraeel, tell me more about that turban.&quot;<BR>
&quot;Allah created a turban from his light and he entrusted it
to Ridhwan, the angel-custodian of paradise, and the praising
of Ridhwan's host of angels belonged to the owner of that turban
before heaven and earth were created. Tonight, when the order
came for your visit, Ridhwan took the turban from paradise, and
all forty thousand angels said with him: 'Our Rabb (Lord), you
have ordered us from time immemorial to praise the owner of that
turban. Honour us tonight with his sight and permit us to walk
before him.' And Allah granted them what they asked. Then Allah
ordered me, Jibraeel, to hand Mikaeel the precious jar of the
pure water of Salsabil, and Mikaeel to give to Azraeel, and Azraeel
to give it to Israfeel, then Israfeel to Ridhwan, then Ridhwan
sent that water another time to the highest paradise: Jannat al-Firdaws,
where all the beautiful maiden-angels washed their faces with
that water and shone even more brightly. Then they sent back that
water to me, and I am giving it to you.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">And Muhammad (pbuh) showered
with the water from paradise. As soon as it touched his noble
body he became covered with a garment of subtle angelic light,
and Jibraeel gave him the buraq to ride. But the buraq stopped
and asked Jibraeel: &quot;Is that Muhammad (pbuh) who is invited
to our Rabb (Lord)?&quot; Jibraeel said: &quot;Yes.&quot; The
buraq asked: &quot;Is he the owner of the blessed pond in paradise?&quot;
Jibraeel said: &quot;Yes.&quot; The buraq said: &quot;Is he the
leader of the people of paradise?&quot; Jibraeel said: &quot;Yes.&quot;
The buraq said: &quot;Is he the intercessor on Judgment-Day?&quot;
Jibraeel said: &quot;Yes.&quot; At that time the buraq began to
melt like ice and snow melt in the light of the sun. He knelt
down and said to Muhammad (pbuh): &quot;Pride of creation, ride
on me; but I have one request to ask of you: Do not forget me
on the day of intercession.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">THE JOURNEY TO
THE FAR-DISTANT MOSQUE</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">When Muhammad (pbuh) began
to ride he was crying. Jibraeel asked him: &quot;Rasool Allah,
why are you crying? &quot; He said: &quot;I remembered human beings.
Are they going to ride on Judgement Day as I am riding now on
the buraq, and go to their heavenly palaces in paradise?&quot;
Jibraeel said: &quot;Yes, truely, we are going to resurrect the
pious ones in delegations of riders: On the Day when We shall
gather the righteous unto the Beneficent, a goodly company (19:85).&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">At that Muhammad (pbuh)
felt happy, and he rode forward on the buraq. Jibraeel took hold
of the reins while Mikaeel held the saddle, and Israfeel the saddle-cloth.
The buraq moved in space until in the blink of an eye they reached
the place appointed for their first stop in the middle of the
desert. Jibraeel said: &quot;Muhammad, go down and pray to Allah
in this place.&quot; Muhammad (pbuh) said: &quot;What is this
place?&quot; Jibraeel said: &quot;This is the place where you
are going to emigrate, and it is going to be your second city.&quot;
That was the town of Yathrib not far from Mecca, and its name
was going to be Madina.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">In the blink of an eye they
again passed through space until they stopped a second time, and
Jibraeel told Muhammad (pbuh) to come down and pray.<BR>
&quot;Which place is this, Jibraeel?&quot; asked Muhammad (pbuh).<BR>
&quot;This is Sinai, where Musa (Moses) used to speak with Allah.&quot;<BR>
Then the buraq moved in space another time until he reached a
third place where Jibraeel ordered him to pray.<BR>
&quot;And now, where are we, Jibraeel?&quot;<BR>
&quot;You are in Bethlehem, where Isa (Jesus) was born and from
where he spread the message of the King of heavens and of the
earth.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">As Muhammad (pbuh) walked
with delight on the soil where Isa (Jesus) was born, he felt someone
moving near his right shoulder who said: &quot;Muhammad! Wait,
I want to ask you a question.&quot; But Muhammad (pbuh) did not
respond. Then another call came from behind his left shoulder,
but again he did not answer it. Finally, an unimaginably beautiful
mountain covered with the wealth and beauty of this world appeared
in front of him and spoke to him with a human voice, but for the
third time Muhammad (pbuh) did not respond. Then he asked Jibraeel
about the three voices. Jibraeel said: &quot;If you had listened
to the first voice all your nation would have been corrupted because
it is the voice of evil; and had you listened to the second one,
all your nation would have been tyrants because it is the voice
of Satan. And if you had stopped to hear the decorated mountain
all your nation would have preferred this world to the eternal
world.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Muhammad (pbuh) continued
on his way and saw two beautiful angelic beings, one masculine
and one feminine. They wore a beautiful dress and the fragrance
of heaven. They kissed him between his eyes and left. He asked
Jibraeel who were these two. He said: &quot;These are the believers
of your nation. They are going to live in happiness and die in
happiness and they are going to enter paradise.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Then another angel appeared
to him and offered him three cups to drink: one of water, one
of milk, and one of wine. He took the cup of milk and drank, and
Jibraeel said: &quot;You have chosen the cup of fitra: innocence.&quot;
Then a maiden-angel appeared and offered Muhammad (pbuh) three
suits of cloth, one green, one white, and one black. He took the
first two. Jibraeel said: &quot;White is the colour of believers
and green is the colour of paradise. All of your followers are
going to be believers in this world and all are going to enter
paradise in the next.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Then, as Muhammad (pbuh)
was walking on the place where Isa (Jesus) taught, he entered
the Temple of Sulaiman (Solomon) in Jerusalem. He found the temple
full of angels waiting for him. Every angel in the temple represented
a group of angels in paradise. Then he saw all the Prophets (alaihi
salaam) standing in rows. He asked Jibraeel who all these were.
Jibraeel said: &quot;These are your brothers from among the prophets,
and these angels are the leaders of all the angels of paradise.&quot;
Then Jibraeel made the call to prayer, after which he said: &quot;Muhammad,
most honorable of beings in the sight of Allah, proceed to prayer.&quot;
And Muhammad (pbuh) came forward and led the prescribed prayer,
and all the prophets (alaihi salaam) and the angels followed him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Adam spoke saying: - &quot;Praise
be to Allah who created me with His hands and ordered the angels
to prostrate for me and brought out all the prophets from among
my descendants!&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Then Nuh (Noah) said: -
&quot;Praise be to Allah who accepted my prayer and saved me and
my people from drowning with my ship with the help of the angels,
and honoured me!&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Then Ibraheem (Abraham)
said: - &quot;Praise be to Allah who took me as His friend and
gave me a huge kingdom, and gave me prophets for descendants,
and saved me from the fire of Namrood, and made it cool and safe
for me!&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">And Musa (Moses) said: -
&quot;Praise be to Allah who spoke to me without an intermediary
and chose me for His message, and made me victorious over Pharaoh
with the help of his angels, and gave me the Torah which Jibraeel
taught me how to write, and adorned me with His love.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">And Dawood (David) said:-
&quot;Praise be to Allah who revealed the Psalms to me, and softened
the iron between my hands and all other elements, and chose me
for His Message!&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">And Sulaiman (Solomon) said:-
&quot;Praise be to Allah who has made subject to me the winds,
the jinn, and human beings; who taught me the language of birds;
who gave me a kingdom which he never gave to anyone after me,
and supported me with all his angels.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">And Isa (Jesus) said:- &quot;Praise
be to Allah who sent me as a Word from Him to the world, taught
me the Torah and the Gospel, made me cure the deaf, the dumb,
and the leper, made me bring back to life the dead by His permission,
and supported me with Jibraeel and all His angels.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">And Muhammad&nbsp;(pbuh)
said:- &quot;All of you praised your Rabb (Lord) and I praise
Him also, Who sent me as a M0ercy for human beings and revealed
the Quran to me, expanded my breast, took out my sins, raised
me up, made my Nation and all human beings the best that could
be, and called me 'Kind and Merciful'&quot;!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">And Jibraeel said:- &quot;That
is why, Muhammad&nbsp;you are the last of Prophets and a Mercy
for human beings. Prophets and angels, creations large and small,
Allah and His angels send blessings and salutations on His Prophet!
You also send much blessings upon him and utmost greetings! Increase
your praise. Praise is an angel with two eyes and two wings that
flies to Allah directly to ask forgiveness for its reciter until
Judgment Day.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Then Muhammad (pbuh) continued
on his way, riding on the buraq together with all the angels that
came to greet and accompany him. Whenever he passed through a
different universe he found the angels of that universe gathered
to greet and dress him with all kinds of gifts and adornments.
They dressed him with the cloaks of perfection and made him the
possessor of every beauty.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Then Muhammad (pbuh) heard
a very powerful voice coming from Israfeel from behind the veils
of Lordly Power and Angelic Perfection: - &quot;Paradises and
heavens! Angels! Mountains and trees and oceans and rivers! Moons
and suns and stars and planets and constellations! Plunge in to
the beauty and perfection of Muhammad (pbuh). Angels and houris
of paradise, walk with pride! Creation, be happy tonight, for
we are receiving in our presence the Master of human beings and
the Seal of Prophets.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">THE ASCENT -
AL MIRAAJ</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Another voice came from
an angel called Ismaeel, saying: &quot;Heavenly stairs, show yourselves
and descend!&quot; upon which the ladder of heaven descended all
the way from Firdaws, the loftiest paradise, until it reached
the Temple of Sulaiman (Solomon). The arms of the ladder shone
with two heavenly lights, red amethyst and green jasper of the
greatest perfection. Every believer is going to see that ladder
and climb on it. It has one hundred steps and it goes from the
temple to the first heaven.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Jibraeel called Muhammad
(pbuh) and the buraq climbed the first step. There Muhammad (pbuh)
saw all kinds of angels red in colour. On the second step, Muhammad
(pbuh) saw angels in yellow cloth, on the third step the angels
were green and all of them were greeting him and giving him heavenly
gifts which he took and gave to Jibraeel to keep as a trust for
the believers on earth. On the fourth step messenger-angels came
and said: &quot;Jibraeel, keep rising for the Rabb (Lord) is waiting!&quot;
And Muhammad (pbuh) saw their subtle bodies shining and their
faces glittering like mirrors in the sun.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Then he climbed the fifth
step of the ladder and saw a huge world of angels that had no
beginning and no end. All of them were praising Allah and their
only words were: &quot;There is no god only Allah.&quot; He asked
Jibraeel: &quot;How many are these angels?&quot; for he was awed
by their numbers. Jibraeel said: &quot;If the skies and the earth
and the moon and the sun and the stars and galaxies were crushed
into dust and were all piled up, their dust particles would not
be one tenth of the angels of this step of the ladder of paradise.&quot;
Then the buraq climbed up to the sixth step and there a great
surprise awaited Muhammad (pbuh), and a great event took place
which passed all description. An immense, white-upon-white angel
sat on a chair of burnished white gold, accompanied by a great
host of angels with wide, awe-struck gazes looking at the divine
majesty. The white angel stood up and said: &quot;Muhammad, welcome!
I beg you to bless my seat by sitting on it.&quot; When Muhammad
(pbuh) sat on the chair, it melted with love for him and became
a cloud of multicolored light chanting the praise of Allah. Out
of every drop of that cloud Allah created another throne and another
great angel sitting upon that throne.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Then the buraq climbed to
the seventh heaven and Muhammad (pbuh) saw angels whose light
replaced the light of his vision, as in the case when someone
looks at the sun and his sight is stolen away. At that time, he
became able to see whatever these angels were seeing. Then he
climbed the eighth step of the ladder and saw nothing but angels
in prostration. He quickly climbed to the ninth so as not to disturb
them. On the ninth step of the ladder he saw angels which passed
description and he stood in awe, unable to comprehend their creation.
At that time their leader appeared and said: &quot;Rasool Allah!
we are dressing you with the secret of our creation and enabling
you to understand all things by Allah's permission.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Then Muhammad (pbuh) went
up to the tenth step of the ladder and saw the angels that praised
Allah in all the languages that had been created since the beginning
of creation. Muhammad (pbuh) wondered at the limitless creations
of Allah. At the eleventh step, the angels numbered even more
than the angels of the fifth step, and out of them an infinite
number of colours glowed, different for each single one of them.
At the twelfth step, Muhammad (pbuh) found angels with faces like
moons and eyes like stars. The light of their faces were covering
their words. On the thirteenth step, the most beautiful angels
appeared and these were the angels of Allah, praising Allah with
soft voices and revelling in other-worldly beauty. Their music
did not resemble any other kind of music and if one tone of that
music were heard on the earth everyone on it would faint.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">On the fourteenth step Muhammad
(pbuh) saw the angel Ismaeel with seventy thousand angels riding
on horses. Behind everyone of them was a battalion of one hundred
thousand angels created from the attribute of Beauty. It is the
duty of each and everyone of these angels to appear on earth at
least one time to bring it the touch of his beauty. The fifteenth
to the twenty-fourth steps were under the command of the angel
Ruqyaeel, great and small, thin and wide. The twenty-fifth step
to the ninety-ninth were presided by the angel Qalaeel. His right
hand was under the first heaven. Between each two of his fingers
there are seven hundred thousand angels continuously praising
Allah. For each of the praises that they utter strings of pearls
come out of their mouth. The diameter of every pearl is eighty-one
miles. For each pearl Allah creates an angel that guards it and
keeps it as a trust for human beings until they enter paradise.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Then Muhammad (pbuh) saw
a huge throne from a precious element other than gold standing
on five posts. Each post has two wings and each wing encompasses
the constellation of our world five times. On each wing rest fifty
thousand angels, each of whom ask forgiveness for human beings
in a different dialect and yet in complete harmony and with an
angelic sound that melts the rocks of the seven earths. Out of
each one of their tears Allah creates fifty thousand angels more
whose task is to ask forgiveness in the same way as these angels
do and in many times more dialects than they. Then the throne
spoke to Muhammad (pbuh) and said: &quot;I and the angels who
guard me were created to carry human beings to their stations
in paradise.&quot; Then, the throne invited Muhammad (pbuh) to
sit on it, and when he sat he felt a pleasure he had never experienced
before.</FONT></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">---------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
Blessings and Peace on Muhammad, his Family, and his Companions.<BR>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">THE FIRST PARADISE:
THE ABODE OF PEACE</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Muhammad (pbuh) arrived
at the hundredth step where he heard the angels praising and glorifying
their Rabb (Lord) in the first heaven. It is called Dar as Salaam,
the Abode of Peace, and has one hundred and twenty-four thousand
doors. Each door represents a prophet. Jibraeel knocked at the
door reserved for Muhammad (pbuh). A voice said from inside: &quot;Who
is it?&quot; Jibraeel replied: &quot;It is Jibraeel and Muhammad
(pbuh).&quot; The voice said: &quot;Has he been sent for?&quot;
Jibraeel said: &quot;Yes, he has been called to the Divine Presence.&quot;
The door was opened. The angel Ismaeel came on a horse of light,
covered in a cloth of light, holding a staff of light. In his
right hand, Ismaeel carried all the deeds of human beings performed
during the day, and in the other, all that they had done during
the night. One thousand processions of angels accompanied him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Ismaeel said: &quot;Jibraeel,
who is with you?&quot; He replied: &quot;The Prophet Muhammad&nbsp;(pbuh).&quot;
Ismaeel said: &quot;Has he been sent for?&quot; Jibraeel replied
yes. Then the buraq was invited to land on the first paradise,
the nearest paradise to the world. It is also called As Samaa
ad-Dunya: the nearest heaven. This paradise can be compared to
a rolling wave held in mid-air; Allah spoke to it and said: &quot;Be
a red emerald,&quot; and it was. The praising of its inhabitants
is: Subhana zil Mulki wal Malakut: &quot;Praise be to the Possessor
of the earthly and the heavenly dominions.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Then Muhammad (pbuh) looked
at the first heaven and found an angel formed like a man. All
the actions that belong to human beings are displayed to him.
If the spirit of a believer comes to him he sends it to paradise;
if the spirit of an unbeliever comes to him he asks forgiveness
for it. When forgiveness is granted he sends it to paradise. He
has a tablet made of light which hangs from the throne to the
first heaven. He writes on it the names of those who are sent
to paradise. Then Muhammad (pbuh) saw a man with an angelic power
towards whom he felt a great attraction. When he asked who that
man was, Jibraeel said: &quot;This is your father, Adam.&quot;
Adam greeted him and said to Muhammad (pbuh): &quot;Welcome to
the good son and the righteous Prophet.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">There are two doors to the
right and the left of Adam. When he looks at the right side he
is happy and when he looks at the left he weeps. Muhammad (pbuh)
asked what these two doors were. Jibraeel said: &quot;The door
to the right is the door to paradise and rewards. When Adam sees
his children entering it he smiles and is happy. The door to the
left leads to punishment and the fire. When Adam sees his children
entering it he weeps and is sad for them. Out of each of his tears
Allah creates an angel who asks forgiveness until the day when
forgiveness is granted and they are allowed to enter into paradise.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Then the angels began to
recite: <BR>
&quot;I yearn to see the one whom Allah created<BR>
To be unique in creation!<BR>
No beloved one is purer nor more elevated than that one,<BR>
Allah's beloved is His servant, the Praised One (Ahmad)<BR>
Whose name was cut out from the name<BR>
Of the Most Glorious One.<BR>
His are the attributes that no eloquence can express.<BR>
It is enough honour that for him the moon split in two.<BR>
What more do you ask than Allah's perfecting of his beauty?<BR>
And truely Allah endowed him with the best character.<BR>
And truely Allah created his light to be the greatest blessing,<BR>
And He called him &quot;Beloved&quot; before He created creation.<BR>
And because of his light the sun was clouded over,<BR>
Because of his overwhelming light filling the firmament.<BR>
The clouds showed a great miracle and moved<BR>
Like a wild herd,<BR>
And thunder clapped and rain poured<BR>
Upon his mere request.<BR>
What more do you want than the softening of the rock<BR>
When he walked upon it with his sandalled feet,<BR>
Although you did not see its marks<BR>
When he tread on the sand?<BR>
Allah has elevated him to His presence<BR>
And the angelic world.<BR>
Were it not for him, there would never be paradise,<BR>
Nor heavens, and no earth.<BR>
What an honour Allah bestowed upon him when He gave<BR>
Ten salutations to those who would<BR>
Send to him only one!&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">They moved for five hundred
thousand light-years within the radius of the first paradise.
The buraq moved faster than the speed of light, for each of its
steps could reach wherever his sight did. The entire distances
they travelled were filled with angels whose number is known only
to the Creator, praising Him and glorifying Him with all kinds
of praises. There was not one handful of space but it was occupied
by an angel in prostration. They were all sizes, big and small.
A voice came saying: &quot;My beloved Muhammad! all these angels
are glorifying Me, and I am sending all this praise as waves upon
waves of angelic blessings to support human beings through their
daily life. These blessings will guide them towards everything
that concerns them, and open for them all kinds of physical and
spiritual knowledge that will help them progress in their ways
of life, materially and spiritually. I will raise them through
this angelic power and enable them to enter My paradise when they
come to My Divine Presence.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">THE SECOND PARADISE:
THE ABODE OF CONSTANCY</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Then Jibraeel ordered the
buraq to take Muhammad (pbuh) to the second paradise, whose name
is Dar al Qarar, the Abode of Constancy. He then knocked at one
of the doors of the second paradise. It was made of a heavenly
element that has no name in our language. The angel Jarjaeel came
with one thousand processions of angels who made an even greater
and happier music than the angels of the first paradise. A voice
said: &quot;Who is it?&quot; <BR>
&quot;Jibraeel.&quot;<BR>
&quot;Who is accompanying you?&quot;<BR>
&quot;Muhammad, the Prophet of Mercy.&quot;<BR>
Then the door was opened. Muhammad (pbuh) saw angels whose faces
were like the disk of the sun, riding horses and girded with spiritual
swords and lances. Muhammad (pbuh) asked: &quot;Jibraeel! who
are these?&quot; Jibraeel answered: &quot;These are angels whom
Allah created to support humans against devils. Their praising
is: Subhana zil `Izzati wal Jabarut: 'Glory to the Rabb (Lord)
of Force and Might,' and they are wearing yellow turbans on their
heads. When they praise Allah their turbans move and radiate a
yellow light that supports the light of the sun. They radiate
another light also, which makes the devils run away and chases
out gossip from the heart of believers.&quot; Then Muhammad (pbuh)
saw two very handsome men sitting on a throne made of red rubies.
He asked: &quot;Who are these?&quot; Jibraeel said: &quot;They
are your relatives, Yahya (John) and Isa (Jesus).&quot; Isa (Jesus)
was of a reddish complexion as if he came out of the bath. Then
angels came to Muhammad (pbuh)&nbsp;in battalions, greeting him
one by one. Allah extended time in such a way that one second
was enough to greet all of the angels and pray with them, for
the time of prayer had come. Isa (Jesus) and Yahya (John) greeted
Muhammad (pbuh) farewell, and Jibraeel ordered the buraq to go
to the third paradise.</FONT></P>

<P><CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">THE THIRD PARADISE:
THE ABODE OF ETERNITY</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Muhammad (pbuh) moved in
space for another five hundred thousand light-years until they
reached the third paradise. It is called Dar ul Khuld: the Abode
of Eternity. As they approached their destination they heard great
voices that thundered all around them. &quot;That is the sound
of angels praising their Rabb (Lord),&quot; said Jibraeel. As
they approached they heard the music of the angels by which everything
moves in the orbits of the heavenly worlds. Jibraeel stopped at
a door made of a pure, burnished heavenly copper, and he knocked.
&quot;Who is there?&quot; said a voice behind the door. &quot;Jibraeel,
bringing Muhammad.&quot; &quot;Has he been sent for?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot;
And the door was opened.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Muhammad (pbuh) entered
and he saw an angel who changed from one shape to another in every
moment. As he changed, his colour changed also. He seemed as one
moving in a flash and yet immobile like a moving series of pictures
and yet each picture is fixed in its place. Behind the angel Muhammad
(pbuh) saw seven hundred thousand angels, all of them moving like
the first angel, from one colourful image into another, like countless
kaleidoscopes. Their feet reached the seven earths. Their musical
praise was: Subhan al Hayy ul Qayyum al lazi la yamut: &quot;Glory
to the Living One, the Self-Subsistent who never dies!&quot; The
melody of their praise moved the entire heavens to unutterable
joy which showered mercy on the earth and its inhabitants. Muhammad
(pbuh) asked Jibraeel to ask the angel whether human beings could
hear that music and if it were possible for them. The angel said:
&quot;Anyone who opens his angelic power and connects himself
to us will hear that melody and he will receive the reward that
we receive for uttering this praise.&quot; Then the angel recited:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Secret Reality! Angelic
heart of light,<BR>
Kingdom of power, shining in steadfast light,<BR>
Firm in foundation, in beauty all complete,<BR>
Its essence descended from Adam's heart enthroned,<BR>
Just as the All Merciful descended on His Throne.<BR>
Essence of angels' light in Adam manifest,<BR>
And yoked with it Allahs' trust fulfilled,<BR>
The grant He made to all mankind.<BR>
Here appeared knowledge of Allah's light<BR>
Known only to chosen saints who alone can see.<BR>
Where His knowledge glows imperfection flees<BR>
And all worldly cares dim and disappear.<BR>
Here ends and begins the place of drawing near<BR>
Where the pure ones settled, similar to light upon light.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">As they moved forward they
saw a handsome man before whose beauty everything paled. &quot;This
is Yusuf (Joseph), the Prophet,&quot; said Jibraeel. Muhammad
(pbuh) approached him and greeted him, and Yusuf (Joseph) greeted
him back with the best greeting of heaven. Jibraeel said: &quot;Out
of the beauty of Yusuf (Joseph) came the beauty of all human beings.
His is the beauty of the full moon, the sun and the stars.&quot;
Yearning for angelic beauty will melt the hearts of the stone
hearted. The faint hearted cannot hope to approach its secret,
for they will immediately fall under its power and extinguish
themselves in it. That is the meaning of the sweetness of painful
yearning in love: the approach of beauty in its absence is sweeter
still than its embrace and possession. For possession of the beloved
entails the satisfaction of the lower self, while to remain in
pain because of the beloved is better than comfort and contentment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Behind Yusuf, Muhammad (pbuh)
saw a great human crowd, all of them wearing radiant angelic dresses.
Muhammad (pbuh) asked, &quot;Who are these people, Jibraeel?&quot;
He answered: &quot;Behind Yusuf (Joseph), Allah created seven
hundred thousand posts in paradise; on each post there are seven
hundred thousand red jewels; each jewel contains seven hundred
thousand palaces; in every palace there are seven hundred thousand
rooms, and in every room there are seven hundred thousand windows.
These rooms are inhabited by human beings who carry angelic powers
and spend their lives in love of each other and nature. Their
hearts are filled with love of Me and devoid of low desires. They
pine for Me and I pine for them. Every day these human beings
appear at their windows and look at the people of paradise. From
their beauty a great light shines forth, in the same way that
the sun appears in the windows of the sky and sheds its light
over the people on earth. Then the people of paradise say: 'Let
us run towards the Lovers of Allah.' As soon as they reach them
these Lovers adorn them with all kinds of rainbows and showers
of light. They give them a dress made of green silk which symbolizes
the qualities of those made perfect and agreeable to Allah.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">THE FOURTH PARADISE:
THE SHELTERING GARDEN</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Then Jibraeel called for
prayer and Muhammad (pbuh) led the prayer among all the inhabitants
of paradise. Then the buraq moved for another five hundred thousand
light-years during which they travelled towards the fourth heaven
which is called Jannat al-Maawa: the Sheltering Garden. There
they heard a voice mixing angels and spirits. The door was made
of silver upon a floor of gold. Again, the voice behind the door
asked: &quot;Who is there?&quot; and Jibraeel answered, &quot;Muhammad.&quot;
&quot;Has he been sent for?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; And the door
opened.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Muhammad (pbuh) saw angels
standing and sitting, lying and bowing, praising and saying: &quot;Subhan
al Malik al Quddus Rabb al Malaaikati war Ruh,&quot; : &quot;Glory
to the holiest King, Rabb (Lord) of the angels and the Spirit!&quot;
Muhammad (pbuh) asked Jibraeel, &quot;Jibraeel, is that not the
prayer of my grandfather Abraham?&quot; and Jibraeel said, &quot;Yes,
this is how your grandfather Abraham used to pray, and Allah was
so happy with that prayer that he created an entire host of angels
and filled the fourth heaven with them. He ordered them to repeat
the same prayer. If anyone recites that praising among human beings,
Allah will give them rewards according to the number of these
angels.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Then Muhammad (pbuh) saw
two angels, one of transparent crystal like spring water, and
one denser like salt water. Jibraeel said: &quot;One is the angel
of sweet waters. He carries all the oceans of this universe with
his right thumb. The other is the angel of salty waters. He carries
all the oceans of this universe in his left thumb. These are the
angels responsible for supporting every creature in creation through
water, sweet or salty. They meet without mixing, as Allah has
said: &quot;He has loosened the two seas. They meet. There is
a barrier between them. They encroach not one upon the other.&quot;
(40:19-20)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Behind them Muhammad (pbuh)&nbsp;saw
angels shaped like birds, standing on the bank of a great river
of paradise. When a human being on earth says: &quot;There is
no god only Allah,&quot; one of these angel-birds opens his wings.
If the person says: &quot;Glory to Allah,&quot; the angel-bird
enters the river to swim in it. When the person says: &quot;Praise
be to Allah,&quot; the angel-bird dives into the water. When the
person says: &quot;Allah is greatest,&quot; the angel-bird comes
out of the river. When the person says: &quot;There is no power
nor might except in Allah,&quot; the angel-bird will shake off
the water from him, and seventy thousand drops of water will come
from him, out of each of which Allah creates an angel that asks
forgiveness for that person until Judgment Day. In addition to
this, Allah orders forty thousand rewards written in the book
of that one and keeps them for him until his resurrection.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Then Muhammad (pbuh) saw
a man who leaned against the books of human beings, in which were
inscribed all their deeds. Muhammad (pbuh)&nbsp;asked: &quot;Who
is this?&quot; Jibraeel said: &quot;This is the Prophet Idris,
peace be upon him.&quot; Muhammad (pbuh) approached Idris and
greeted him. Idris greeted him back and said: &quot;Welcome to
the pious brother and perfect prophet.&quot; Above him Muhammad
(pbuh) saw a dome of light on which was written: &quot;There is
no god only Allah, Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.&quot; Muhammad
(pbuh) looked inside it and saw a venerable old man with a white
beard filled with light and crowned with a white turban. He asked:
&quot;Who is that, Jibraeel?&quot; He answered: &quot;That is
an angel representing the Prophet Idris.&quot; Muhammad (pbuh)&nbsp;greeted
him and said: &quot;My brother! Allah has elevated you and honoured
you, and you have entered paradise before me and saw its pleasures.&quot;
Idris said: &quot;Beloved one! At first I did not enter paradise
nor see its pleasure. But when I left this world I entered a garden
with a door on which I saw: 'Beyond this door none may enter before
Muhammad (pbuh) and his nation.' And I asked Allah, 'For the sake
of my grandson Muhammad (pbuh), let me in.' Allah let me in, so
now because of you I am in this place.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Then Idris recited:<BR>
&quot;This Station sought by all for shelter,<BR>
This lofty place where all people bow subdued<BR>
And stands the noble Messenger<BR>
With wisdom and might endued,<BR>
Station of guidance and angelic light<BR>
Where gloom of night and orphans' sadness<BR>
At once are effaced,<BR>
This is the Station of direct communication<BR>
And the firm foothold for those determined to reach.<BR>
The All-Merciful called him His beloved one<BR>
And he is the beloved one of the universe<BR>
And from his light came the light of all life.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">THE FIFTH PARADISE:
THE GARDEN OF BEAUTY AND FELICITY</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Muhammad (pbuh) travelled
for five hundred thousand light-years, after which he arrived
at the fifth paradise which is called Jannat al Naeem: &quot;the
Garden of Beauty and Felicity.&quot; Its door is made of mixed
gold and silver from heaven. Jibraeel knocked at the door and
a voice said: &quot;Who is it?&quot; &quot;Jibraeel, bringing
Muhammad (pbuh).&quot; &quot;Has he been sent for?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot;
&quot;Welcome, Beloved one, to the fifth paradise!&quot; The door
opened and Muhammad (pbuh) saw five beautiful ladies whose radiant
light among their servants made them appear like diamonds surrounded
by pearls. His heart was moved towards them. He asked Jibraeel:
&quot;Who are these ladies?&quot; He answered: &quot;This is Hawwa
(Eve), the mother of human beings, this is the Virgin Maryam (Mary),
the mother of Isa (Jesus), this is Musa's (Moses') mother Yukabid,
and this is Assia, the wife of Pharaoh.&quot; The fifth lady looked
like a sun among stars. Her light shone over the rest of the inhabitants
of that paradise like a gentle breeze passing through the tree-leaves.
Jibraeel said: &quot;This is an angel representing your daughter
Fatima&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Muhammad (pbuh) asked: &quot;Jibraeel,
what is the secret of this paradise?&quot; Jibraeel said: &quot;Allah
created this paradise to reflect the beauty and perfection of
women. The light of this paradise is the source of the angelic
lights of all women on earth. Women have been created to carry
the secret of creation in themselves. Allah has honoured them
greatly by making their wombs the repository of His word which
represents the Spirit. He looks at the most sacred place and there
descends His mercy and blessings. He perfected that place and
covered it with three protective layers to shelter it from any
damage. The first is a layer of light, the second a layer of love,
and the third a layer of beauty. There he fashions and creates
human beings after His likeness, as Muhammad (pbuh) said: 'Allah
created Adam after His likeness.' He orders the angels of the
womb to perfect His creation by giving the baby life, beauty,
health, intelligence, and all kinds of perfect attributes that
will make each one distinguished among human beings.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">&quot;Women are not created
weaker but more generous than men. They are created more beautiful
and less fierce, as beauty hates to hurt and harm others. That
is why they seem weak to people, but in reality they are not.
Angels are the strongest of created beings, and women are closer
to the angelic nature than men, as they are readier than men to
carry angelic light. It is the good manners and ethics of spirituality
which they carry which makes them less forceful than men. Even
physically, however, they are extremely strong. They undergo great
upheavals in their body without flinching for the sake of childbirth,
and face the direst physical conditions more successfully than
men because Allah has enabled them to insure the survival of generations.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">&quot;Allah gave women five
angelic qualities which men rarely have. They are the source of
peace, as Allah said that He created them &quot;so that you might
find rest in them&quot; (30:21). This is the attribute of the
first paradise which is named &quot;the Abode of Peace.&quot;
They are oasis of constancy in the midst of chaos and change.
That is why they give birth as the mother nurtures and shelters
the baby more reliably than the father. This is the attribute
of the second paradise, which is named 'the Abode of Constancy.'
They perpetuate generations. Through their offspring Allah creates
angelic prophets and saints who establish His perpetual remembrance
on earth as the angels establish it in heaven. This is the attribute
of the third paradise which is named 'the Abode of Eternity.'
They are generous and bountiful. They are described as 'a fertile
land' in all Scriptures because they give without counting, including
life. They sacrifice themselves for the sake of another creation,
and this is the attribute of the fourth paradise which is named
'the Sheltering Garden.' Finally, they are the source of Beauty.
Through their softness and subtlety, Allah has crowned the earth
with the diadem of angelic grace. This is the attribute of the
fifth paradise which is named &quot;the Garden of Beauty.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">THE SIXTH PARADISE:
THE GARDEN OF EDEN</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Muhammad (pbuh) travelled
again on the buraq for five hundred thousand years. On his way
to the sixth paradise which is called Jannat al Aden: &quot;the
Garden of Eden,&quot; he saw nations and nations of saffron-coloured
angels standing on pedestals of pink marble. They had one thousand
wings and on each wing there were one thousand faces. Each face
had one thousand mouths saying: &quot;Praise be to the Rabb (Lord)
of Majesty and Splendour!&quot; Jibraeel knocked at the door of
the sixth paradise which was made of aquamarine and gold. As usual,
a voice asked from behind the door who was there and the answer
was given: &quot;Jibraeel, bringing Muhammad (pbuh).&quot; &quot;Has
he been sent for?&quot; said the voice. &quot;Yes,&quot; replied
Jibraeel. The door was opened. Muhammad (pbuh) entered and what
he saw passed all imagination and all recorded books, all fabled
accounts, all legends, all histories.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Silent gold sat on stars
of pearl. Under every pearl fifty thousand angels whirled in a
lake of galaxies producing a heavenly sound like a million birds
humming on top of the buzzing of a million bees. Everything is
moving at the speed of light but at the same time everything is
silent and still. Each angel spoke words of greetings to Muhammad
(pbuh) at the same time in a different language but distinctly
and without any clash one with the other. Their words were phrased
in diadems and garlands of light which he wore one after the other
on his head and around his neck. A huge angel named Semlaeel appeared
at the head of ten thousand processions of similar angels wearing
a crown of multi-coloured garnets and reciting praise of Allah
in an angelic language which made each angel swoon and rise up
in turn. These were the karubiyyun: 'Those brought near.' No one
on earth can see them and live because of the intensity of their
light which they borrow from the One they behold.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Muhammad (pbuh) asked: &quot;Jibraeel!
What is this untarnished heavenly sound?&quot; &quot;Rasool Allah!&quot;
Jibraeel answered, &quot;This is the music of the angelic souls
in the presence of their Rabb (Lord) trembling like a leaf, not
daring to move or speak, awed and annihilated by perfection, yet
vivified and moved by divine Light, rushing to the divine meeting
and announcing your coming.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Muhammad (pbuh) saw a honey-coloured
angel of astounding beauty and of yet even greater majesty so
that his majesty overpowered his beauty. He had a long mane of
hair and a long beard out of which light flashed like thunderbolts.
He had a stern face and yet a child's eyes. His enormous chest
seemed to heave like a dormant volcano under his shirt of heavenly
brocade. When Muhammad (pbuh) enquired about him, Jibraeel said:
&quot;This is your brother Musa (Moses). He is the one who prayed
six times on the Mount of Sinai in order to be a simple servant
in your Nation. He is the vanquisher of tyrants and the secret
of his father Yaqoob (Jacob). Allah wrote for him the character
of a fiery servant. That is why he approached the burning bush
and was not afraid when His Rabb (Lord) wanted to speak to him.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Musa (Moses) was crying
and he said to Muhammad (pbuh): &quot;Prophet of the Last Nation!
Intercede for me and my people.&quot; Muhammad (pbuh) said: &quot;Why
are you crying, my brother Musa (Moses)?&quot; He replied: &quot;I
cry for love of you and for the great honour where Allah has raised
you and made your nation countless people and other nations very
few, even mine. Muhammad! you are the seal of prophets and the
light of creation. Allah is raising you today to His presence,
to a station where no-one can reach. Remember me there as Allah
made you the intercessor for all human beings including prophets,
from Adam to Isa (Jesus). Then he recited:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">&quot;Prophet sprung from
Hashim's line,<BR>
Lover of Him Who is lauded above,<BR>

Allah in Whose presence none before had remained,<BR>
Approach that place where only angels draw near<BR>

And lay open clear myriad paths to celestial light.<BR>

JANNAT AL FIRDAWS</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Muhammad (pbuh) arrived
at the seventh paradise whose roof touches the Heavenly Throne
and whose name is Jannat al Firdaws, after a travel of five hundred
thousand light-years. He knocked at the door which was made of
pure emerald, topaz, beryl, and gold. After he entered he saw
another gate of light. From it came the praise of nations of hidden
angels at whose sight one would die of awe because of their intense
beauty. Their laud was simply: &quot;Praise be to the Creator
of Light!&quot; Beyond this it is not permitted to speak about
them. Muhammad (pbuh) greeted them with the greeting of peace
and proceeded past the gate of gold to a dome of light which encompassed
all the previous heavens, although the distance he had travelled
between the sixth and the seventh heaven was the same as that
between each two of the other layers of paradise.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Inside the dome Muhammad
(pbuh) saw an angelic being which resembled him in every fashion
and who was leaning against a wall of white silk which seemed
to move like a waterfall and yet stand firm. Muhammad (pbuh) asked
who that was and Jibraeel said: &quot;This is your grandfather
Ibraheem (Abraham), the leader of the pure of heart and a great
one among prophets.&quot; Ibraheem (Abraham) said: &quot;Welcome
to the pious son and the perfected Prophet!&quot; Around Ibraheem
(Abraham) stood crowned angels. Each of their crowns contained
four hundred diamonds, each worth more than what the entire earth
contains. At their service stood throngs of angels crowned with
the light of the previous angels and all were reading the Ayat
ul Kursi. Jibraeel said: &quot;This is the verse that keeps the
universe firm in the balance. This is the secret of the order
of Creation.&quot; And the angels recited:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Allah! There is no god save
Him, the Living, the Eternal, Neither slumber nor sleep overtakes
him. Unto him belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever
is in earth. Who is he that intercedes with him save by His leave?
He knows that which is in front of them and that which is behind
them, While they encompass nothing of His knowledge except what
He will. His Kursi includes the heavens and the earth, And He
is never weary of preserving them. He is the Sublime, the Tremendous.
(2:255)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Circumambulating the building
against which Ibraheem (Abraham) leaned, the entire universes,
the throngs of angels of the seven heavens, the angels of mercy
and the angels of wrath, the angels of beauty, the angels brought
near, the great and the small angels, the visible and the invisible
angels, and all the human beings whose angelic souls had been
purified and elevated to the divine presence, the prophets, the
truthful saints, the martyrs, the righteous, all of creation whirled
and turned in the same direction as every heavenly body, counterclockwise,
around the Kaaba of the heavens. Muhammad (pbuh) said: &quot;Jibraeel,
How wondrous are the incredible marvels of my Rabb (Lord)!&quot;
And Jibraeel replied: &quot;Muhammad! You have seen only a glimpse
of the wonders of Allah.&quot;</FONT></P>

OF THE FURTHEST BOUNDARY</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Muhammad (pbuh) and Jibraeel
travelled once more until they reached the absolute limit of the
created intellect, named Sidrat al Muntaha: &quot;The Furthest-Tree
of the Furthest Boundary.&quot; There they saw nothing which the
tongue could describe. The effect of the sight they beheld on
Muhammad (pbuh) is a secret which took place in his heart. A sound
came to them from above which dissipated some of Muhammad's (pbuh)
astonishment. At that time he saw a large tree which does not
resemble any of the trees of paradise, a tree without description,
covering all the paradises, heavens, and universes. The trunk
of the tree was a huge angel named Samrafeel. Muhammad (pbuh)
could see nothing else besides it. It grew from an infinite, unimaginable,
indescribable ocean of musk. The tree had an infinite number of
branches, created from a heavenly element that has no name in
a created language. The distance between one branch and another
was five hundred thousand light-years. On every branch there was
an infinite number of leaves. If all the created universes were
placed on a single one of these leaves they would disappear, like
an atom disappears inside an ocean of water. On every leaf sat
a huge angel in a multi-coloured light. On his head was a crown
of light and in his hand a staff of light. Written on their forehead
was the inscription: &quot;We are the inhabitants of the Furthest-Tree.&quot;
Their praise was: &quot;Praise be to Allah Who has no end.&quot;
Their names are the Sarufiyyun, &quot;The secret ones,&quot; because
they are created from the absolute secret of their Rabb (Lord).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">From the trunk of the tree
four absolute springs issued. The first was a pure, transparent,
crystal water; the second was a river of white milk; the third
was a river of pleasurable, untarnished wine that elevates without
abasing; the fourth was a river of pure honey mixed with gold.
Inside the trunk was the prayer-niche of Jibraeel, and his constant
words of praise are: Allahu Akbar: Allah is Great! to which the
reply always comes from above: Ana Akbar: I am Greater! Ana Akbar:
I am Greater!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Jibraeel entered his prayer-niche
and he called for the prayer. All the Sarufiyyun stood in rows
and Muhammad (pbuh) led them in prayer. The prayer finished and
all the Sarufiyyun were ordered to give their greetings to Muhammad
(pbuh) one after the other. After this, a great angel came out
from behind Jibraeel's prayer-niche and asked Muhammad (pbuh)
to approach.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Muhammad (pbuh) and Jibraeel
entered the trunk of the tree and reached in a glance the entire
sight of creation. On the top of the tree they saw Adam and Hawwa
and Nuh, Ibraheem, Musa, Isa, and all the other prophets whom
they had just visited. With them they saw all their respective
nations, sitting with them in spirit together with those of Muhammad's
nation who had already left this world. All were sitting there
together, happy, basking in the love and beauty of their Rabb's
(Lord's) mercy and praising Him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">That Furthest-Tree carries
the knowledge of all of Allah's creation from the beginning of
its sequence in time. Whatever is created is part of it and contained
in it. It was called the tree &quot;of the furthermost boundary&quot;
because everything ends in it and after it begins a new life.
Allah decorated it with the light of His own essence. It has three
characteristics: a continuous shade of light extending over every
creation, a continuous pleasure reaching everyone from the fruit
of its branches, and a continuous fragrance from its flowers scenting
with beauty the life of creation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Then Muhammad (pbuh) and
Jibraeel moved forward. A stern and severe angel appeared and
covered the horizon before them. Jibraeel said: &quot;Muhammad!
This is the angel of death, Azraeel.&quot; The angel of death
said: &quot;Welcome, Muhammad! You who bear goodness, and welcome
to all the prophets and their nations. This is the place from
which I gaze at the destinies of every person and seize the spirits
of those whom I am commanded to bring to eternal life.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Muhammad (pbuh) asked: &quot;Tell
me how you take the souls of the dying.&quot; The angel of death
revealed to Muhammad (pbuh): &quot;When Allah orders me to take
the spirit of a human being at the last hour of his life and the
first hour of his afterlife, I send to him my deputies who carry
with them the smell of paradise and a branch from the tree of
paradise which they put between his eyes. When that sweet smell
reaches him and he catches a glimpse of that heavenly branch,
his spirit is attracted and his soul begins to ascend to paradise,
until it reaches his throat. At that time, I descend from my place
and I take his spirit with the greatest care, because Allah wants
this moment to be easy on His servant. I then carry his soul to
paradise. On the way, whenever I pass by angels, then angels will
greet this soul and salute it until it reaches the presence of
its Rabb (Lord). Allah the Exalted says to that soul at that time:
&quot;Welcome to the good spirit which I created and placed in
a good body! My angels! Write the upper layer of paradise as a
reward for that person.&quot; Then angels take him up to paradise,
where he will see what Allah has prepared for him and he will
be happy to stay there. However, Allah orders the spirit to go
back to his body on earth, where he can see the<BR>
people washing him, crying for him, and all those who love him
standing around him until they take the body to the grave. There
the soil says to him: &quot;Welcome, my beloved one! I was always
yearning for you when you were above me. Now you are in me and
I will show you what I am going to give you.&quot; Immediately,
his grave will be enlarged beyond sight, until the two angels
of the grave come and ask him about his Rabb (Lord) and about
his belief. He will give them the correct answers by Allah's permission.
At that time they will open for him a door leading to paradise
and his spirit will go back upward to the same place where Allah
first called him to His presence.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">&quot;I remember when death
had separated us.<BR>
I consoled myself with the thought of the Beloved Prophet.<BR>
I said: All of us go on this way one day.<BR>
Who does not die today, he will die tomorrow.<BR>
Be happy, my soul, because your Rabb (Lord) is waiting for you<BR>
And the beloved one is calling you.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Then Jibraeel moved forward
another five hundred thousand light-years, mounted on the buraq,
until they reached a place where Jibraeel began to slow down.
Muhammad (pbuh) said: &quot;Jibraeel! Why are you slowing down?
Are you leaving me?&quot; Jibraeel replied: &quot;I cannot go
further.&quot; Muhammad (pbuh) said: &quot;Jibraeel, don't leave
me alone.&quot; &quot;Muhammad!&quot; Jibraeel said, &quot;You
now have to step down from the buraq and move to a place which
no-one has entered before you.&quot; At that moment the buraq
stopped and was unable to move further. Muhammad (pbuh) stepped
down and moved hesitantly. Jibraeel said: &quot;Muhammad, move
forward without fear. If I were to continue with you I would be
annihilated for the greatness of the Light.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Muhammad (pbuh) moved, and
moved, and moved. He saw Mikaeel standing ahead of him, afraid
and trembling. The light of his face was changing quickly from
one colour to another. Muhammad (pbuh) asked: &quot;Mikaeel, is
this your station?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; Mikaeel answered, &quot;and
if I were to trespass it I would be annihilated. But you go on
and don't stop.&quot; Muhammad (pbuh) moved, and moved, and moved.
Then he found Israfeel with his four huge wings, one of which
covered his face to veil him from the light which came from the
horizon of everything. Muhammad (pbuh) asked him: &quot;Is this
your station, Israfeel?&quot; Israfeel said, &quot;Yes. If I trespass
it, that light would burn me. But you move on and do not fear.&quot;
And Muhammad (pbuh) moved, and moved, and moved. He saw the Spirit
to whom Allah gave the power of earth and the heavens. From the
top of his head to the bottom of his feet and from every cell
of his there were faces with traits of subtle light, the number
of which no-one knows but Allah, and from the each of which Allah
creates an angel-spirit which looks like the Spirit, whom He then
takes to himself as the spirit-angels of the Divine Presence.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Every day the Spirit looks
into hell three times, and because of the cool light of his angelic
gaze the fire of hell melts until it becomes as a rainbow. The
Spirit also looks into paradise three times every day and extends
to it the divine light which Allah gives him. If Allah gathered
the tears of the eyes of the Spirit it would flood all the created
universes and make Nuh's (Noah's) flood seem like the drop gathered
by a needle dipped into the ocean. This is the Spirit whom Allah
mentioned in the Quran:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">&quot;The day when the Spirit
and the angels rise, no-one shall speak except with permission
from His Rabb (Lord).&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Muhammad (pbuh) said: &quot;Spirit!
Is this your station?&quot; The spirit replied: &quot;Yes, and
if I trespass it I will be annihilated by the light which I am
receiving. Muhammad! Move forward and do not be afraid. You are
invited and you have permission.&quot; Muhammad (pbuh) moved forward.
Allah inspired his heart with the following discourse: &quot;I
the Rabb (Lord), have veiled myself from the inhabitants of paradise,
as I have veiled myself from the inhabitants of the earth. As
I veiled Myself from their minds, I veiled myself from their vision.
I am never in anything, and I am never away from anything.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Muhammad (pbuh)&nbsp;then
moved through one veil after another until he passed through one
thousand veils. Finally he opened the Veil of Oneness. He found
himself like a lamp suspended in the middle of a divine air. He
saw a magnificent, great and unutterable matter. He asked his
Rabb (Lord) to give him firmness and strength. He felt that a
drop of that presence was put on his tongue and he found it cooler
than ice and sweeter than honey. Nothing on earth and the seven
paradises tasted like it. With this drop, Allah put into Muhammad's
heart the knowledge of the First and the Last, the heavenly and
the earthly. All this was revealed to him in one instant shorter
than the fastest second. He was ordered to move forward. As he
moved he found himself elevated on a throne that can never be
described, now or later. Three additional drops were given to
him: one on his shoulder consisting in majesty, one in his heart
consisting in mercy, and an additional one on his tongue which
consisted in eloquence. Then a voice came from that presence,
which no created being had heard before: &quot;Muhammad! I have
made you the intercessor for everyone.&quot; At that moment Muhammad
(pbuh)&nbsp;felt his mind enraptured and taken away to be replaced
with an astonishing secret. He was placed in the fields of Allah's
Eternity and Endlessness. In the first he found no beginning and
in the second he found no end. Then Allah revealed to Him: &quot;My
end is in My beginning and My beginning is in My end.&quot; Then
Muhammad (pbuh) knew that all doors were absolutely closed except
those that led to Allah, that Allah cannot be described within
the confine of a place in speech, and that Allah encompasses the
everywhere of all places. This is a secret that no tongue can
be stirred to express, no door opened to reveal, and no answer
can define. He is the Guide to Himself and the Rabb (Lord) of
His own description. He is the Beauty of all beauty and the speech
by which to describe Himself belongs to Him alone.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Allah my Creator, in Your
infinity do I stand amazed.<BR>
In Your ocean of unity do I drown submerged.<BR>
Allah, at times You are close to me in familiar intimacy.<BR>
At times You leave me without, veiled and strange,<BR>
Hidden in Your sovereign Majesty.<BR>
Give me to drink the wine of Your love,<BR>
For only drunk from it am I able to say:<BR>
My Rabb (Lord)! Let me see You.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Muhammad (pbuh) then looked
on his right and saw nothing except His Rabb (Lord), then on his
left and saw nothing except his Rabb (Lord), then to the front,
to the back, and above him, and he saw nothing except his Rabb
(Lord). He hated to leave that honoured and blessed place. But
Allah said: &quot;Muhammad, you are a Messenger to My servants
as all Messengers, if you stay here you would never be able to
communicate My Message. Therefore descend back to earth, and communicate
My message to My servants. Whenever you want to be in the same
state as you are now, make your prayers, and I shall open this
state for you.&quot; This is why Muhammad (pbuh)&nbsp;stated:
&quot;Prayer is the apple of my eyes,&quot; and he called it also:
&quot;Our rest.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Then Muhammad (pbuh)&nbsp;was
ordered to go back to earth, but he left the self in heaven and
his spirit at the Furthest-tree, and his heart in the unutterable
divine presence while his secret was left suspended without place.
His self wondered: &quot;Where is the heart?&quot; And the Heart
wondered: &quot;Where is the spirit?&quot; And the spirit wondered:
&quot;Where is the secret?&quot; And the secret wondered where
it was. And Allah revealed: &quot;Self of Muhammad (pbuh)! I granted
you the blessing and the forgiveness, and spirit! I granted you
the mercy and the honour, and heart! I granted you the love and
the beauty, and secret, you have Me.&quot; Allah then revealed
to Muhammad (pbuh) the order to recite: &quot;He is the one who
sends blessings on you, together with His angels, in order to
bring you out from darkness into light&quot; (33:43). &quot;Muhammad!
I have ordered the angels of all My heavens, those created and
those yet uncreated, to send blessings on you and My creation
unceasingly, with My own praise. I am your Rabb (Lord) Who said:
My Mercy has taken over My anger. And all My angels I have created
for you human beings.&quot; And Allah ordered Muhammad (pbuh)&nbsp;to
descend with this angelic message back to earth.</FONT></P>
