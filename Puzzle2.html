Muhammad <IMG SRC="Images/saws.gif" WIDTH="25" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="BOTTOM"

<P><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">QUOTES FROM <I>THE
MYSTERIES OF HUMAN SOUL</I> by IMAM GHAZZALI</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">From Chapter: <I>The
Reality of the Human Soul</I></FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">The human soul is an
essence and can produce consciousness or intelligence, and it
is the property of the living soul. It recognises itself and its
Creator and knows spiritual realities.</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">From Chapter:<I> Attachment
of Soul to Dead Bodies in Their Graves and on the Day of Resurrection.</I></FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">Death of the body does
not cause the death of the soul, because the latter does not subsist
in the body. Rather the attachment of soul to body (during the
lifetime of the body) is astonishing indeed, for the soul is not
in the body.</FONT></I></P>

<P><CENTER><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">DEFINITION OF
WITNESS</FONT></I></CENTER></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">WITNESS (noun) TESTIMONY;
Attestation of a FACT or EVENT; One who KNOWS or SEES anything;
One who gives evidence in a trial.</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">In any court of law, in
any country, a witness is someone who has evidence of a fact or
event. That means the person knows about or has seen the event.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">A person who is not present
at the event in question, cannot be called a witness. A person
who has no connection with the event in question, cannot be called
a witness.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">To put it another way:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">No one will call anyone
a witness, a person who is absent from the event in question,
and therefore that person has nothing to do with, or has no connection
with the event in question.</FONT></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1">THE FIRST TESTIFICATION</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1">KALIMA TAYYAB</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">THERE
IS NO GOD ONLY ALLAH MUHAMMAD IS THE RASOOL OF ALLAH</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">This Kalima is the
minimum requirement for a non-Muslim to repeat with the intention
of becoming a Muslim. Allah accepts that person as a Muslim. For
a Muslim, the belief in this Kalima is the basic requirement.</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1">THE SECOND TESTIFICATION</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1">KALIMA SHAHADAH</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1">(TESTIFICATION OF BEING
A WITNESS)</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">ASH HADU
AL LA ILAHA ILL ALLAHU WA ASH HADU AN NA MUHAMMADAN ABDUHU WA

<P><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">I TESTIFY
(BEAR WITNESS TO THE FACT) THERE IS NO GOD ONLY ALLAH AND MUHAMMAD
IS HIS SERVANT AND RASOOL (MESSENGER)</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">The second Kalima
is much more involved. In every two Rakah of Salah (prayer) it
is recited once. In every four Rakah Salah it is recited twice.
It is recited from 17 to 23 times in total (counting all the Salah)
every 24 hours, depending on the number of Rakah of the four different
schools.</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">The Muslims are
the only community who are called as WITNESSES to this FACT 17
to 23 times a day.</FONT></CENTER></P>
