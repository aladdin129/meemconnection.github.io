<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Al Manee is the Preventer.
Allah is the Preventer of all kinds of fortune or misfortune,
whether visible or invisible. Let us examine a quote from the
Quran:</FONT></B></P>

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="Images/Ch18_55.gif" WIDTH="480" HEIGHT="94"
ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">55</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#009900" FACE="Arial"> And what is there to prevent mankind
from believing now that guidance has come to them and from praying
for forgiveness from their Rabb (Lord), unless (they wish) the
ways of the ancients be repeated with them or they should be confronted
with the doom.</FONT></I></B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">[Quran: Al
Kahf, Chapter 18]<BR>
</FONT></I></B></CENTER></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">In the above reference
we are told: What is there to prevent mankind from believing&#133;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">The answer is not that
obvious from a first glance, it is very subtle! We have to look
at the verses that follow and deduce the answer from there. The
verses that follow the above reference are:</FONT></B></P>

<P><CENTER><B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">56</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#009900" FACE="Arial"> We only send the Messengers to
give good news and to warn. But the unbelievers dispute with false
argument in order to refute the truth and they treat our signs
as a jest as also the fact that they are warned! <BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">57</FONT><FONT COLOR="#009900"
 FACE="Arial"> And who does more wrong than one who is reminded
of the signs of his Rabb (Lord), then turns away from them forgetting
the (deeds) which his hands have sent forth? We have set veils
over their hearts so that they should not understand this and
over their ears deafness. And though you call them to guidance,
even then will they never accept guidance.</FONT></I></B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">[Quran: Al
Kahf, Chapter 18]</FONT></I></B></CENTER></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial"><BR>
From verses 56 and 57 we can deduce that Allah in His infinite
Mercy sent Messengers to warn the people. Therefore the choice
for belief of disbelief is given to the individual. If there was
no such choice, then there is no point in sending any Messengers!
Here is the subtlety, as soon as we start to argue in order to
refute the truth, or if we mock the truth, Allah prevents us from
understanding the truth. The truth can only be 'seen' or understood
if we approach it with an open mind. If we approach the truth
with an open mind, then Allah will give us the understanding required
to analyse the truth. We must not be hasty in drawing our conclusions
or in refuting the truth immediately. Remember the first lesson
we learnt was As Saboor. Therefore we must be patient with the
process of understanding. Insha Allah then Allah will not prevent
us from believing the truth.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Which reminds me of numerous
occasions when someone in difficulty, approached my brother for
guidance. He gave them Zikr Allah. As soon as they were given
the Zikr Allah, they immediately said: &quot;What good is that
going to do?&quot; As soon as these words are spoken, Allah prevents
that person from receiving any goodness from that Zikr. They lose
it there and then. This is the state of Muslims! May Allah forgive
us from such utterances and may Allah prevent us in future from
such utterances.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Allah is Forgiving, we
must hasten towards repentance. Then, there have been non-believers
who come for guidance and the same Zikr Allah works for them within
days. Why? Because they come with sincerity and they take the
Zikr Allah with awe and respect. And they do the Zikr every night.
Allah not only bestows on them goodness but He also guides them
to the right path. Allah removes the veils from there hearts and
ears so that they begin to understand. Islam is not just for the
Muslims. It is for all beings.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Then there is another
category of Muslims who prevent non-believers from doing Zikr
Allah. Who or what gives them that right?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Now if we continue from
the above reference verses 56 and 57, we are told:<BR>
</FONT></B></P>

<P><CENTER><B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">58</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#009900" FACE="Arial"> But your Rabb (Lord) is the Forgiving,
Full of Mercy. If He were to call them (at once) to account for
what they have earned then He would have hastened their punishment:
but they have their appointed time beyond which they will find
no refuge. <BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">59</FONT><FONT COLOR="#009900"
 FACE="Arial"> Such were the populations We destroyed when they
did wrong, but We fixed an appointed time for their destruction.</FONT></I></B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">[Quran: Al
Kahf, Chapter 18]</FONT></I></B></CENTER></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Allah, our Rabb is the
Forgiving, Full of Mercy. Allah gives everyone an opportunity
to turn towards the truth so that He may remove the veils that
prevent the non-believers from understanding the truth. If they
still do not believe, then the punishment awaits at the appointed
time and not a moment before.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Let us finish with one
more example from the Quran:</FONT></B></P>

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="Images/Ch38_75_.gif" WIDTH="475" HEIGHT="104"
ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">75</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#009900" FACE="Arial"> (Allah) said: &quot;Iblis! what
prevents you from prostrating yourself to one whom I have created
with My hands? Are you proud, or are you one of the high (and
mighty) ones?&quot; <BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">76</FONT><FONT COLOR="#009900"
 FACE="Arial"> (Iblis) said: &quot;I am better than him. You created
me from fire and You created him from clay.&quot;</FONT></I></B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">[Quran: Saad,
Chapter 38]<BR>
</FONT></I></B></CENTER></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">In this example Iblis
or Satan was asked what prevented him from bowing down to Adam
(<IMG SRC="Images/Hamza.gif" WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">). In reality it was Allah who
prevented him from bowing down! How? The answer is in the next
verse, where Iblis did not even try to understand the creation
of Adam (<IMG SRC="Images/Hamza.gif" WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">). He just looked at the visible
form and decided that he was more superior to Adam (<IMG SRC="Images/Hamza.gif"
WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">).
Had he thought out the creation of Adam (<IMG SRC="Images/Hamza.gif"
WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">)
and realised that Allah had created Adam (<IMG SRC="Images/Hamza.gif"
WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">)
with His hands. And Allah had breathed into Adam (<IMG SRC="Images/Hamza.gif"
WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">)
His breath. Iblis on the other hand had neither of these qualities.
Iblis would have realised the superiority of Adam (<IMG SRC="Images/Hamza.gif"
WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">)
over him. Since Iblis did not have an open mind, Allah prevented
him from understanding the superiority of Adam (<IMG SRC="Images/Hamza.gif"
WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">)
over Iblis. Iblis was hasty.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">We have come back to
where we started this article. We must have an open mind when
it comes to learning Islam. We must not be hasty in making quick
decisions over what is the truth and what is not.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Al Manee <IMG SRC="Images/40.gif"
WIDTH="19" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">
is the Preventer. The Preventer is none other than Allah <IMG 
SRC="Images/1.gif" WIDTH="9" HEIGHT="25" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">. Allah prevents those who are hasty and lack
patience and those who mock His signs and revelations from seeing
<IMG SRC="Images/50.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="21" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> the light or Noor. That light
is the real vision and that vision is <IMG SRC="Images/70.gif"
WIDTH="27" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">
Ilm or knowledge. Behind every visible thing, there is a hidden
meaning. May Allah prevent us all from being hasty and keep us
all on true guidance. Ameen.<BR>
