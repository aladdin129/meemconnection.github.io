and the earth. The similitude of His light is as a niche wherein
is a lamp. The lamp is in a glass. The glass is as a shining star.
Kindled from a blessed tree, an olive neither of the east nor
of the west, whose oil would almost glow forth though no fire

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Light is not light without
the darkness. The visible is not visible without the invisible.
Manifest is not manifest without the hidden. Good is not good
without the evil. Heaven is not heaven without the earth. East
is not east without the west.<BR>
The point we are making here is that everything has an opposite.
If there were no opposites, there would be nothing but Allah.
Neither you nor I would be here! Allah has created everything
in pairs.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Allah is the Light
of the heavens and the earth.</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#000000"
 FACE="Arial"> In both the heavens and earth the Light is from
Allah. Everything in heavens and earth is lit with the Light of
Allah. With that light, everything has become manifest. What is
this Light?<BR>
<I>The similitude of His light is as a niche wherein is a lamp.</I>
What is a lamp? A lamp is a vessel containing oil. A lamp has
a wick that is lit to burn that oil contained within it. A lamp
supplies light. <BR>
<BR>
The lamp is in a glass. Glass is a fragile material. Glass is
translucent. Glass is transparent. We can see through glass! That
is glass does not get in the way of the vision. We ignore the
presence of glass when we look through a window. Therefore we
can see the lamp through the glass.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">The glass is as a shining
star. In this verse we are told that the glass is like a shining
star. The glass surrounding the lamp usually shines when the lamp
is lit. Here the opposite to the last paragraph is also true.
Just as vision can see through the glass unhindered, likewise
the light can shine through the glass unhindered.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Kindled from a blessed
tree, an olive neither of the east nor of the west. </FONT></I><FONT
 COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">A tree takes years to grow. It begins
from a seed. It grows into a plant. Then it becomes a strong tree.
Then the tree produces fruit. In this example the fruit is the
olive. But this tree is neither of the east or west. If we observe
a tree, it is planted in a particular place. It does not move.
But this particular tree is neither of the east nor of the west.
Therefore this tree is either a heavenly tree or it moves!</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Whose oil would almost
glow forth though no fire touched it.</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#000000"
 FACE="Arial"> The oil in the lamp is lit. Yet fire has not touched
it. It generates light. <I>Light upon light, Allah guides to His
light whom He will. And Allah speaks to mankind in allegories,
for Allah is knower of all things.</I></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">A man of knowledge once
said &quot;The heavens and earth cannot contain Allah, and yet
Allah lives in the heart of a true believer.&quot; Now if we look
at the entire verse, we find that the Light referred to in the
above verse is Knowledge. The tree neither of the east or west
is the human. The heavens and earth cannot contain knowledge,
yet the human being can contain knowledge of heavens and earth.
Where is this light referred to in the above verse? It is as a
niche (a recess) where there is a lamp. The human heart is in
a niche in the human body. The heart is lit from a blessed tree
neither of the east or west. The red Indians call the trees the
standing people. The human being is not rooted in one place. The
heart pumps without being lit and no batteries are required!</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">The heart is the place
of unravelling of the mysteries, if the Light of Allah shines
in there. The heart is the place of Zikr Allah, if the of Light
of Allah shines in there. And as Mawlana Abul Noor Muhammad Bashir
so beautifully wrote: &quot;In this day and age we keep hearing
of people having heart attacks. If there is no Zikr Allah in a
heart, what do you expect? It is bound to stop!&quot; <BR>
The heart or the lamp needs fuel. The fuel or oil is the Zikr
Allah. With Zikr Allah, the lamp is lit without being touched
by fire. The human body becomes a blessed tree neither of the
east nor of the west. Light upon light, is achieved by that tree
in the form of knowledge upon knowledge. Every branch of knowledge
is based on certain principles or foundation. And the knowledge
is built on that principle or foundation. Our foundation is Islam
and the knowledge is the Quran and Sunnah of Muhammad <IMG SRC="Images/saws.gif"

Allah guides to His light whom He will. Finally a reference from
the Quran:</FONT></B></P>
