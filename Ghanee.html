<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Al Ghanee is the Self
Sufficient. Whereas Al Mughnee is the Enricher. To be Self Sufficient,
one has to be the Enricher! Only Allah is the Enricher and the
Self Sufficient. That is Allah does not need anything to exist.
All existence needs Allah to exist. All existence is dependent
on Allah to exist. Let us look at an example from the Quran:</FONT></B></P>

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="Images/Ch29_5_.gif" WIDTH="407" HEIGHT="123" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">5</FONT><FONT COLOR="#009900" FACE="Arial"> For those whose look forward to
the meeting with Allah the term (appointed) by Allah is surely
coming: and He hears and knows. <BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">6</FONT><FONT COLOR="#009900" FACE="Arial"> And if any strive they do so for their own souls:
for Allah is free of all needs from all creation.</FONT></I></B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">[Quran: Al
Ankabut, Chapter 29]<BR>
</FONT></I></B></CENTER></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Allah is free of all
needs from all creation. Allah is Self Sufficient. Whatever good
we do is for our own souls. It is not because Allah needs us,
or our good deeds! The lesson here is that Allah is the Self Sufficient
and we are not. We have to strive to do good deeds for our own
souls. If Allah does not need our good deeds then why do we need
to do good deeds?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">The answer is simple.
If we do not do any good deeds, after death our souls will be
in continuous turmoil. If we do not do any good deeds, we will
suffer eternal pain and torture. It will be extremely difficult
to escape from that eternal torture. We will be weighed down with
the 'heaviness' of our evil deeds. Now let us look at the reason
for doing good deeds. Again we need to look at the verses following
the above reference:</FONT></B></P>

<P><CENTER><B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">7</FONT><FONT COLOR="#009900" FACE="Arial"> Those who believe and do good deeds
from them We shall blot out all evil in them and We shall reward
them according to the best of their deeds. <BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">8</FONT><FONT COLOR="#009900" FACE="Arial"> We have enjoined on man kindness to parents, but
if they strive (to force) you to join with Me (in worship) anything
of which you have no knowledge, then do not obey them. You have
to return to Me and I will tell you (the truth) of all that you
did. <BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">9</FONT><FONT COLOR="#009900" FACE="Arial"> And those who believe and do good deeds We shall
admit them to the company of the righteous.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">[Quran: Al Ankabut,
Chapter 29]<BR>
</FONT></I></B></CENTER></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Referring to verse 7
above, if we do good deeds, Allah will blot out all evil in us.
What does that mean? As stated above, evil deeds will cause 'heaviness'
or 'darkness' on our souls. That is what will be weighed on the
Day of Judgement. For every good deed, Allah will remove some
of that weight from our souls, so that the soul becomes light.
Now if we look at the next verse Allah tells us to be kind to
parents. Why?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">When we were born, we
were helpless. Allah placed love and kindness in the hearts of
our parents so that they looked after us. Our parents taught us
how to look after ourselves, that is to clean ourselves, dress
ourselves, help ourselves to food when we are hungry. One of the
reasons Allah tells us to be kind our parents is because our parents
did their best to make us self sufficient in looking after ourselves
to the best of our ability, all with Allah's permission. And finally
another example from the Quran:</FONT></B></P>

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="Images/Ch22_64_.gif" WIDTH="498" HEIGHT="200" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">64</FONT><FONT COLOR="#009900" FACE="Arial"> To Him belongs all that is in the
heavens and on earth: for truly Allah, He is free of all needs,
worthy of all praise. <BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">65</FONT><FONT COLOR="#009900" FACE="Arial"> Have you not seen how Allah has made subject to
you (men) all that is on the earth and the ships that sail through
the sea by His command? He withholds the sky from falling on the
earth except by His leave: Allah is Kind and Most Merciful to
mankind.</FONT></I></B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">[Quran: Al
Hajj, Chapter 22]</FONT></I></B></CENTER></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">In the above reference
we are told that everything in heavens and earth belongs to Allah
who is Self Sufficient. Then in verse 65 there is message for
us the creation. What is that message?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Allah has created everything
on earth for us. Allah has made everything on earth for our service.
In this example, the ship that sails through the sea and the sea
are all obeying Allah's command. However Allah is giving us a
hint. What is that hint?<BR>
Allah is not going to send us the ship from heaven! It is not
because Allah is not able to do that. Allah can do whatever He
wills as we are told in the Quran, Al Maida Chapter 5 verse 114.</FONT></B></P>

<P><CENTER><B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">114</FONT><FONT COLOR="#009900" FACE="Arial"> Jesus the son of Mary said: &quot;Allah
our Rabb (Lord)! Send us from heaven a table set (with food) that
there may be for us for the first and the last a feast and a sign
from You. Give us sustenance for You are the best Sustainer.<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">115</FONT><FONT COLOR="#009900" FACE="Arial"> Allah said: &quot;I will send it down for you.
And if any of you disbelieves after that I will punish him with
a penalty such as I have not inflicted on anyone among all the
peoples.</FONT></I></B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">[Quran: Al
Maida, Chapter 5]</FONT></I></B></CENTER></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">That is when Isa (<IMG SRC="Images/Hamza.gif" WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">) asked Allah to send down a table
with food from heaven so that everyone can have their fill. And
Allah did send that. But look at the condition that was imposed
for sending a table! There is no room for disbelief after Allah
provides. If anyone disbelieves after that, the punishment will
be such that which has not been inflicted on anyone.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">But in the case Nuh (<IMG SRC="Images/Hamza.gif" WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">) Allah guided him to build a ship
for himself and those that Allah wanted to save from the flood.
We have to learn to be a little self sufficient and build 'the
ship' ourselves with the knowledge that Allah has given us. Allah,
the Kind, the Merciful has created everything on earth so that
we may become self sufficient to a certain extent. We should praise
Allah for being so generous. We should praise Allah for giving
us the chance to utilise His gifts on earth to our advantage.
We should praise Allah for making us a little self sufficient.
Instead we abuse the gifts given to us by Allah on the earth.
And we complain about insignificant things. And this is confirmed
in the following verse from the previous reference:</FONT></B></P>

<P><CENTER><B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">66</FONT><FONT COLOR="#009900" FACE="Arial"> It is He who gave you life will
cause you to die and will again give you life: truly man is a
most ungrateful creature!</FONT></I></B></CENTER></P>

</FONT></I></B></CENTER></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">In reality, Allah, Al
Ghanee <IMG SRC="Images/1000.gif" WIDTH="27" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> - The Self Sufficient wants us

that Light to seek knowledge <IMG SRC="Images/10.gif" WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="23" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> so
that we become self sufficient. May Allah enlighten us all and
make us all self sufficient to the best of our ability. Ameen.</FONT></B></P>
