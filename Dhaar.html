BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> THE DISTRESSER</FONT></CENTER></H2>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Adh Dhaar is the one
who causes Distress. We found in the previous article, An Nafee,
that it is Allah who creates both the favourable and unfavourable
conditions for profit and loss respectively. Similarly, it is
Allah who causes Distress since everything in heavens and earth
belong to Him as shown in the following reference from the Quran:</FONT></B></P>

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="Images/Ch16_52_.gif" WIDTH="417" HEIGHT="177"

<P><CENTER><B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">52</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#009900" FACE="Arial"> To Him belongs whatever is in the
heavens and on earth and religion is His forever. Will you then
fear any other than Allah? <BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">53</FONT><FONT COLOR="#009900"
 FACE="Arial"> And whatever goodness you have is from Allah. When
you are touched by distress, you cry to Him for help. <BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">54</FONT><FONT COLOR="#009900"
 FACE="Arial"> When He removes the distress from you behold, some
of you attribute partners to their Rabb (Lord)</FONT></I></B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">[Quran: An
Nahl, Chapter 16]<BR>
</FONT></I></B></CENTER></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Why does Allah the most
Merciful cause distress to His creation? Allah causes us distress
in order to test our faith. Allah causes us distress in order
to test our patience. Allah causes us distress in order to separate
the true believer from the one who just performs lip service.
Allah causes us distress in order to make us strong so that no
matter what happens, we will not leave His religion. If we leave
His religion then we are the ones that will be at a loss and in
distress.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">However, there is a very
subtle lesson to be learnt. If we do not suffer distress, we cannot
appreciate comfort. If we do not suffer distress, we will become
weak. If we become weak, we will perish at the slightest distress
or infection.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">It is better to bear
the distress in this world. The distress that will be caused to
the disbelievers in the next world will be unbearable. At least
in this world we have the opportunity to turn towards our Rabb
and ask Him to remove our distress. In the next world, there is
no such avenue open to us for relief from distress.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">But as we are told, in
the above reference (16:54) <I>When He removes the distress from
you behold, some of you attribute partners to their Rabb</I>.
How do we associate partners to our Rabb?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">As it was stated in the
article on An Nafee, it is Allah who creates favourable conditions
for profit and it is Allah who creates unfavourable conditions
for a loss. Likewise, no person, no jinn, no angel, no star, no
planet can cause distress. Each of the latter act according to
the will of Allah. For ordinary people, it appears that the distress
is caused by a person, jinn, angel, star or planet. In reality
they are all obeying what Allah has ordained for them. Therefore,
relief can only come from Allah, when we turn to Him for help.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Yet when we are relieved
of our distress by Allah, some of us attribute the relief to medicine,
or person, or favourable stars etc. Who created the plants and
herbs for the medicine? Allah !</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Who created the person
who came to our assistance? Allah! Who created favourable stars?
Allah! We must start with the words Al Hamdu Lillah - All Praise
is for Allah we feel relieved by this medicine. Al Hamdu Lillah,
Allah sent such a person for my assistance.</FONT></B></P>

<P><CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">There is another
side to being inflicted by distress. That is shown here in the
following Hadees:<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">Rasool Allah said,
&quot;No fatigue, nor disease, nor sorrow, nor sadness, nor hurt,
nor distress befalls a Muslim, even if it were the prick he receives
from a thorn, but that Allah expiates some of his sins for that.&quot;</FONT></I></B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">[Sahih Bukhari]</FONT></I></B></CENTER></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">From this Hadees we learn
that whenever a believer is inflicted with distress or hurt or
sadness or sorrow or disease or fatigue, Allah removes some of
the sins of a believer. Allah is so generous that He is looking
for an excuse to forgive us our sins. For that we have to pay
a small price. That small price is in the form of distress or
hurt etc. But, if Allah is so generous, why does He not forgive
our sins without causing us distress?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">The answer is quite simple.
It is human nature to devalue anything that is given for free.
It is human nature not to appreciate something until it is lost.
For example, good health is a gift from Allah. We cannot appreciate
good health unless we have experienced illness. However, we must
be patient under such circumstances in order to be forgiven some
of our sins and at the same time we must be thankful to Allah
in all conditions. We must praise Allah in health as well as in
sickness. It is Allah who brings about the distress and it is
only Allah who can relieve us from that distress. How do we ask
Allah to relieve us from distress? One of the best Dua or prayer
in times of distress is that of Ayub (<IMG SRC="Images/Hamza.gif"
WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">):<BR>
</FONT></B></P>

<B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">83</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"
 FACE="Arial"> </FONT><FONT COLOR="#009900" FACE="Arial">And Ayub
(Job) when he cried to his Rabb (Lord) &quot;Truly distress has
seized me and You are Most Merciful of those that are merciful.&quot;</FONT></I></B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">[Quran: Al
Anbiyaa, Chapter 21]</FONT></I></B></CENTER></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">From the above reference
we can see and appreciate how Allah relieves a person from distress.
First we must call upon Allah, our Rabb. And then we must praise
Him. In this example Ayub (<IMG SRC="Images/Hamza.gif" WIDTH="12"
HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">) called
his Rabb and said to his Rabb, <I>&quot;Truly distress has seized
me and You are Most Merciful of those that are merciful.&quot;</I><BR>
All forms of distress <IMG SRC="Images/800.gif" WIDTH="31" HEIGHT="22"
ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> are from Allah.
And only Allah <IMG SRC="Images/1.gif" WIDTH="9" HEIGHT="25"
