<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">The Arabic letter Meem
is equivalent to the letter </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">'M'</FONT><FONT

Meem in Arabic numerology which is known as Abjad, has the value
of 40. What is the significance of the number 40? &quot;Life begins
at forty&quot;. Where does this saying come from? From the Quran
of course:</FONT></B></P>

 COLOR="#009900" FACE="Arial"> And We have commended unto man
kindness toward parents. His mother bears him with reluctance,
and brings him forth with reluctance, and the bearing of him and
the weaning of him is thirty months, till, when he attains full
strength and reaches forty years, he says: My Lord! Arouse me
that I may give thanks for the favour You have given me and my
parents, and that I may do good deeds acceptable to You. And be
gracious unto me In the matter of my seed. I have turned to You
repentant, and I am of those who surrender (unto You).</FONT></I></B></CENTER></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">From the physical point
of view: At the age of forty, a person should reflect on his/her
life. On average, two thirds of the persons life is already passed
and only one third remains, if Allah Wills. It is a time for a
new beginning. It is a time to turn to Allah and seek his forgiveness
if we have not already started. It is a time to start thinking
of our own death often and be prepared for it. It is not for morbid
reasons, but to abstain from evil and turn towards good. It is
a time to turn a new leaf and start learning Islam properly because
at that time our children are growing up and we have to set an
example to them. We cannot put all the responsibility on another
persons shoulder, for example the Imam who teaches the children
Islam. If we are not aware of Islam, ourselves how can we distinguish
whether the children are being taught Islam according to Ahl-as-Sunnah
or Islam according to the Ahl-al-Hadees depending on our preference.
If we cannot read the Quran, now is a good time to learn. There
is no shame in asking what we do not know about Islam. It is never
too late to turn towards Allah.</FONT></B></P>

the Quran to Believe in all the Books that He has sent (the original
ones that were revealed and not the modified versions of the Zaboor,

he/she cannot perform any further prayer because then the person
