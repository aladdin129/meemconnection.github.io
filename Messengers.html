WERE ALL OF ALLAH'S MESSENGERS MEN ?</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">It was stated in Meem
Part 1....</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">It is a requirement
for Prophethood that the person is not a woman. It must be man.
A woman cannot be a prophet. Allah says:</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Let us also look at another
verse from the Quran:</FONT></B></P>

<P><CENTER><B><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Noon wal Qalam
wa ma Yastaroon</FONT></I></B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">1</FONT><FONT

they write</FONT></I></B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><I><FONT COLOR="#009900" FACE="Arial">[Quran: Al
Qalam Chapter 68]</FONT></I></B></CENTER></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">What does it mean ? <I>...and
that which they write... </I>Who writes ?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">Have you
ever considered why ?</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">Did Allah
not create Adam (as) before Hawwa (as) ?</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">Did Allah
not create the Qalam first and then the Lawh ?</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">What is Qalam ?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Qalam is a Pen. What
does a pen have in order to write ? It must have ink. The Qalam
is associated with the male species.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">What is Lawh ?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Lawh is the tablet on
which the Qalam - Pen writes. Lawh is associated with the female
species. The ink writes on the Lawh. The Qalam deposits ink in
the Lawh. WORDS are written on the Lawh. In Kashf Al Mahjub it
is stated by Datta Gang Baksh, the &quot;SECRET&quot; is such
that it is beyond human reasoning. Reason cannot grasp it. When
the secret dawns, reason abdicates the mind. After abdicating,
it tries to get a grip on the intelligence. But it fails.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">The secret of creation
has been placed by Allah in the 'ink drop' that is &quot;EMITTED&quot;.
Yet if there is a trace of that &quot;ink drop&quot; on the garments,
Salah is not acceptable.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">That is precisely why
for Prophethood, it is a requirement that the person is a man
and not a woman. Because the secret of creation has been placed
in the sperm drop by Allah. The sperm drop is shaped like the
letter Meem (<IMG SRC="Images/40.gif" WIDTH="19" HEIGHT="15" 
ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">). When Allah created
Isa (<IMG SRC="Images/Hamza.gif" WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">) from Maryam (<IMG SRC="Images/Hamza.gif"
WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">),
Allah created Isa (<IMG SRC="Images/Hamza.gif" WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="18"
ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">) from a MEEM (<IMG 
SRC="Images/40.gif" WIDTH="19" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">). If we write the letter Meem (<IMG SRC="Images/40.gif"
WIDTH="19" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">)
as a word as it is pronounced Meem Ya Meem <IMG SRC="Images/40.gif"
WIDTH="19" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><IMG 
SRC="Images/10.gif" WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="23" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><IMG SRC="Images/40.gif" WIDTH="19" HEIGHT="15"
ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">, what do we find
in the middle of the two Meem letters. We find the letter Ya (<IMG 
SRC="Images/10.gif" WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="23" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">). Have you ever considered why Hadrat Usman
Ghani (<IMG SRC="Images/200.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="19" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">) placed the two dots below the
letter Ya (<IMG SRC="Images/10.gif" WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="23" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">) and not above ? He (<IMG SRC="Images/200.gif"
WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="19" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">)
was told to do so.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Keep the human body in
mind and consider where the Qalam is and where does the ink come
from ? Can a female fulfil this requirement ? NO! Can a man fulfil
this requirement ? Yes!</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">There is a Hadees in
which it is stated, that if the Sajdah was permissible for any
other than Allah, then it would become necessary on the woman
to bow down to her husband. Why ? Because the secret of the creation
from Meem (<IMG SRC="Images/40.gif" WIDTH="19" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">) is placed inside a male by Allah.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Now<I> </I>we know what
the Qalam is, it emits &quot;white&quot; or &quot;milky&quot;
ink. What is the meaning of <I>Noon Wal Qalam</I> -Noon and the
Pen ?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">There are two Noons (<IMG 
SRC="Images/50.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="21" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">) and these also play an important role in
the development of a human being or most other mammals for that
reason, the Qalam starts the process of creation and the two Noons
(<IMG SRC="Images/50.gif" WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="21" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">) complete the infancy when the
infant is being suckled. These two forms of ink play a major part
in the development of the human being by Allah's command. Think
about what has been written above, it is the truth. And here are
two Hadees quotations from Sahih Al Bukhari:</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Uqba married the daughter
of Abu Ihab bin Aziz, and then a woman came and said, &quot;I
suckled 'Uqba and his wife.&quot; 'Uqba said to her, &quot;I do
not know that you have suckled me, and you did not inform me.&quot;
He then sent someone to the house of Abu Ihab to inquire about
that but they did not know that she had suckled their daughter.
Then 'Uqba went to the Prophet in Medina and asked him about it.
The Prophet said to him, &quot;How (can you keep your wife) after
it has been said (that both of you were suckled by the same woman)?&quot;
So, he divorced her and she was married to another (husband).</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">My foster uncle came
and asked permission (to enter) but I refused to admit him till
I asked Allah's Apostle about that. He said, &quot;He is your
uncle, so allow him to come in.&quot; I said, &quot;O Allah's
Apostle! I have been suckled by a woman and not by a man.&quot;
Allah's Apostle said, &quot;He is your uncle, so let him enter.&quot;
And that happened after the order of Al-Hijab (compulsory veiling)
was revealed. All things which become unlawful because of blood
relations are unlawful because of the corresponding foster suckling
relations. [Aisha (</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial"><IMG 
SRC="Images/200.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="19" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><I>)]</I></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">There is a Hadees in
which it is stated that while burying someone, something fell
in the grave. Rasool Allah <IMG SRC="Images/saws.gif" WIDTH="25"
HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> said,
let the person who did not have relations with his wife the night
before go down in the grave and remove it. Do you know why ?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Because the grave is
like a womb. In the first mother's womb we are created from nothing
but a sperm drop. In the second mother's womb (&quot;mother earth&quot;)
the creation process is reversed and we are reduced to dust. Then
we will be created again from this same mother earth's womb on
judgement day. And what does the Hadees tell us about the second
creation ? It will rain, and the rain will be like semen.</FONT></B></P>
