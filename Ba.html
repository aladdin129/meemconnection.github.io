keeping Allah in mind always. Know that Allah Sees our every action,
and Allah Listens to our every word and Allah Knows our every
thought. If we can attain that stage of being conscious of Allah's
Presence, we will keep away from sin. After purifying our outer

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">The definition of an
atom:</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><EM><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff" FACE="Arial">An atom consists
of the smallest indivisible particle. It consists mostly of space.
At the centre of this space is an extremely small core called
the nucleus. The mass is concentrated in the nucleus. Satellites
called electrons travel in orbits around the nucleus.</FONT></EM></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">The pilgrims orbiting
the Kaaba is a visual representation of an atom on a large scale.
The Kaaba is the nucleus and the people orbiting are the electrons.
The Christian nuclear scientists may claim to have discovered
the atom. In fact Allah had told us to look at the letter </FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">Ba</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">
1400 years ago. Unfortunately no Muslim scientist came along up
to the point of the discovery of the atom to prove that what the
Quran reveals is the Truth. We Muslims are always relying on Non-Muslims
to prove the Word of Allah is the Truth. I know verse 96 says
</FONT><EM><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">guidance for all
kind of beings</FONT></EM><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">,</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial"> but it would be excellent if Muslims
discovered some of the signs of Allah in this day and age. It
is not good enough living on past glory. The operative word is
</FONT><EM><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">past</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">.</FONT></EM><FONT COLOR="#000000"
 FACE="Arial"> The majority of the Muslims of today are lagging
behind in science and technological discoveries. While other Muslims
see science and technology as enemy of Islam. The latter ones
are completely misguided. One should seek refuge with Allah from
these misguided ones, because all knowledge comes from Allah whether
it is spiritual or scientific. Both spiritual and scientific knowledge
go hand in hand.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Yet another way of looking
at it. Bismillah, starts with the letter </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"
 FACE="Arial">Ba</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">. This
letter represents the creation. Allah created everything from
a dot. Humans, animals, plants, they are all created from dots
or seeds. Even the seeds themselves are created from dots which
we call atoms. Then if we apply this to gases, minerals and light,
it still applies. Even the atoms if broken down further to electrons,
protons, neutron and photons they all spin in circular motion
around the nucleus, giving the effect of a dot. If we turn towards
the sun, moon, earth and all the other planets, even they are
like dots. Even the orbits of the planets are circular, representing
a dot. Therefore everything we see can be interpreted as a shape,
body or form, or it can be seen as a lot of dots or atoms clinging
together to produce a pattern. They all have one thing in common.
All these, animals, plants, minerals, in fact the entire cosmos
is created by only One Being who is the Creator, Who is not created.</FONT></B></P>

<H3><CENTER><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+2">IS THE DOT
CLOCKWISE OR ANTI-CLOCKWISE ?</FONT></STRONG></CENTER></H3>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Another analogy of </FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">Tawwaf</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"
 FACE="Arial"> (pilgrim circling the Kaaba) is that the Earth
rotates on its axis east to west. Since the sun rises in the east
and sets in the west. This movement is counter clockwise. So is
the </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">Tawwaf</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">, taking the Kaaba as the axis.
The pilgrims circulate the Kaaba counter clockwise. The earth
itself orbits around the sun in a counter clockwise direction.
There was a fifty-fifty chance of being right. Equally, there
was a fifty-fifty chance of being wrong. Since the guidance was
from Allah the </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">Tawwaf</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial"> is in perfect harmony with Allah's
creation of night and day. The Tawwaf is in perfect harmony with
Allah's creation of seasons of the sun.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Now, if we look at the
clocks and watches, their movement is clockwise, which is left
to right as the English language for example. Had the inventor
of the clock been a Muslim we would today have clocks with movement
from right to left. Which is in counter clockwise direction with
numbers also increasing in counter clockwise direction. Then the
counter clockwise direction would have been clockwise direction.
Therefore the inventors of the present day clocks were sub-consciously
trying to master time by designing the clocks that go in the opposite
direction to the rotation of the earth and its orbit. All this
in order to avoid their meeting with their Maker. They overlooked
two things. One, time waits for no man. Two, even if time went
backwards, they would still meet their Maker. Because He existed
at the beginning, He exists now. And He will exist always. Muhammad

about an axis. The discovery of the atom was the scientific advancement

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Going back to the verse
Bismillah. It is the first verse in the Quran when we open the
Quran at the first page. It is displayed at the top of every chapter
in the Quran except for chapter 9. The missing Bismillah is found
in chapter 27 called <EM>Al Naml</EM> in verse 30. If we add the
chapter number 2+7 = 9. So, it was deliberately removed from chapter
9. Now the problem is, Why verse 30 which in single figures is
3 (3 +0) and not verse 20 which would point back to </FONT><FONT

or 2? Well, Al Naml is placed as the third 9, (9, 18, 27) or 9
x 3 = 27. Even if we multiply chapter number with verse number
we get 27 x 30 = 810 = 8 + 1 + 0 = 9. Again we are being told
this is the final stage. You are looking for Bismillah, look again,
but keep in mind the number 3.</FONT></B></P>

 FACE="Arial">La ilaha ill Allah Muhammadur Rasool Allah</FONT></EM><FONT
 COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial"> is automatically being mentioned
by the reciter without the reciters knowledge. This first Kalima
is also known as Kalima Tayyab (Purity). It is the recitation
of this Kalima Tayyab which purifies the Muslim spiritually. All
the Messengers (<IMG SRC="Images/Hamza.gif" WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="18"

that Muhammad <IMG SRC="Images/saws.gif" WIDTH="25" HEIGHT="24"

sent by Allah as the Seal of all the Messengers (<IMG SRC="Images/Hamza.gif"
WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">).
This is another reason why the verse Bismillah was given to all
the Messengers of Allah and their communities from Adam (<IMG

BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">) to Isa (<IMG SRC="Images/Hamza.gif"

The previous Messengers of Allah new the hidden secret in Bismillah.
When the previous communities Messengers left them, Bismillah
was taken away from them. The Muslim community have retained this
verse because they have accepted the visible first Kalima. The
other communities did not receive the first Kalima in the visible
form. In the Kalima, the words are manifest, obvious, unmistakable.
Here the words are hidden or </FONT><EM><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"

When we recite Bismillah with total faith, Allah rewards us for
reciting Bismillah once, plus the reward for saying the first
Kalima three times is added to that reward. Allah is Very Generous
to his creation. Muhammad <IMG SRC="Images/saws.gif" WIDTH="25"
HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> left
us a clue. If we look at the letters the Messenger of Allah <IMG

to Islam, they start with </FONT><EM><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">Bismillah
Hir Rahman Nir Raheem Muhammadur Rasool Allah. </FONT></EM><FONT
 COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">That is the clue that the first
Kalima is hidden in the verse Bismillah. The first half of the
Kalima is hidden, because Allah cannot be seen in this world.
The second half is visible because it is an historical fact that
Muhammad the Messenger of Allah <IMG SRC="Images/saws.gif" WIDTH="25"

their closeness to him. Usman Ghani (ra) knew exactly what he
was doing. In adding the dots and accents he revealed some of
the secrets for those who have eyes. Only those people will see
the hidden Messages whom Allah guides. The obvious reason for
adding the accents and dots is so that anyone, anywhere in the
world can recognise the letters and recite the Quran as it should
be recited with the correct pronunciation. This is the main emphasis
these days. How to pronounce Arabic words correctly, never mind
about understanding the spiritual meaning of what we are reading.
The letters forming the words are visual indication of a message.
Finally when reading the Quran, the hidden letters become manifest.</FONT></B></P>
