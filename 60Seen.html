<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">For disbelievers Allah
has closed this avenue. Notice that out of all the five senses,
sight, touch, taste, smell and hearing, it is the sense of hearing
which is mentioned first in the Quran. Why is there emphasis on
hearing?</FONT></B></P>

<H3><CENTER><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+2">HEARING IS
SUPERIOR TO SIGHT</FONT></STRONG></CENTER></H3>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">It is through hearing,
a person either accepts or rejects what is heard. As far as sight
is concerned, it is defective and prone to error. A good example
of the defectiveness of the sight is that the sun appears to be
a small flat round disk placed in the sky. Whereas in reality
it is many times larger than the earth and it is spherical. Therefore
the eyes cannot be relied on. On the other hand the idol worshippers
rely on a god they can see. This is where they are led astray
from the reality. They worship statues or sun or stars. Ibrahim
(<IMG SRC="Images/Hamza.gif" WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">) turned away from all these because
they all had a flaw. For example the sun disappeared during the
night. The stars disappeared, or were hidden, during the day.
Ibrahim (<IMG SRC="Images/Hamza.gif" WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">) used his logic and decided, how
can a 'God' be completely visible during the day and then set
during the night? Or how can a 'God' be visible during the night
and disappear during the day? He rejected the statues because
they could neither hear nor speak.</FONT></B></P>

<H3><CENTER><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+2">THE FIRST
CALL</FONT></STRONG></CENTER></H3>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Consider a new born baby.
The eyes of the baby cannot focus. The baby cannot distinguish
objects. It takes months for the baby to learn to focus the eyes
and distinguish objects. On the other hand the hearing of the
new born baby is fully functional. For Muslims it is their duty
that the first sound that reaches the ears of a new born baby
is the call of the Azan. The soul is comforted that it has come
to a Muslim household. And it is reminded that it has come from
Allah and it must one day return to Allah. This act of calling
the Azan in the new born's ears confirms that sound and hearing
is far superior than sight. This is confirmed time and time again
in the Quran:</FONT></B></P>

and breathed into him something of His spirit. And He gave you

<H3><CENTER><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+2">THE MESSAGE
OF ALLAH</FONT></STRONG></CENTER></H3>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Initially the Word, the
Message of Allah can only enter our hearts and minds through the
faculty of hearing. If we are born deaf, then the Message of Allah
is not easily understood. To believe in the Message of Allah we
need someone to tell us. We need to <EM>hear</EM> the message.
Even when reading the brain converts the letters into sounds which
are then understood, although the sounds are not audible. In this
instance we are 'listening' to our own brain. In the Quran, there
are numerous accounts of Allah's Messengers (<IMG SRC="Images/Hamza.gif"
WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">)
warning their communities. How did they warn their communities?
By calling out to them. By making them hear.</FONT></B></P>

<H3><CENTER><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+2">SPEECH - COMPLIMENT
OF HEARING</FONT></STRONG></CENTER></H3>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Coming back to the example
of the baby, the child, as it grows, listens to the language of
the parents. Then the child copies those sounds and starts to
utter the first words. Speech is learned through the faculty of
hearing and not through the eyes. When listening to the Quran,
we must listen to it as if for the first time. Only then can we
learn. It is the same process as the learning of a child.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">When the first revelation
was received, it was not written on paper. It was by the sound
made by Jibraeel (<IMG SRC="Images/Hamza.gif" WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="18"
ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">) and Muhammad<IMG 
SRC="Images/saws.gif" WIDTH="25" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> listened. After listening to the Message,
Muhammad <IMG SRC="Images/saws.gif" WIDTH="25" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> repeated it. The faculty of hearing
is a channel to our souls.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Most of us have seen
and observed a hypnotist. All the hypnotist does is use his/her
voice and tells the person being hypnotised to <EM>listen to his/her
voice</EM>. The hypnotist is trying to reach the soul by making
it hear. If the eyes are the windows to ours souls, then the ears
are the doors to our souls. The faculty of hearing is an entrance
to our souls. This has been displayed in the Quran as follows:</FONT></B></P>

<P><CENTER><B><EM><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">83</FONT><FONT

the believers listen and they recognise the Truth when they hear
it. This is due to Allah's Mercy that he does not veil the heart,
mind and hearing of the believer. In the second example, the disbelievers
only listen for the sake of argument. Allah does not permit them
to understand the Message. The third example of the word to listen
is as follows:</FONT></B></P>

to repel the evil suggestions, the whispers, we need to seek refuge
in Allah by reciting the Auzu Billah and other verses of the Quran.
The whispering occurs in the soul. The antidote of the whispering

So the antidote is recited by the body. And the listening is done

simple answer. There is also a spiritual answer. When our Rabb
says </FONT><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">Salaam</FONT></I><FONT
 COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial"> to us we can reply </FONT><I><FONT
 COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">Wa Alaikum As Salaam</FONT></I><FONT
 COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">. Or we can respond with </FONT><I><FONT
 COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">Salaam</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#000000"
 FACE="Arial"> and Magnify our Rabb at the same time. Allah has
shown us how to do that:</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">The reply to the greeting
in chapter 36 Ya Seen verse 58 is in chapter 59. The reply could
have been in chapter 58 to match the verse number 58 in chapter
36. So there is a puzzle to solve here. The answer again comes
from what we have been taught. When we greet someone we say</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ff00ff" FACE="Arial"> <I><STRONG>A</STRONG></I></FONT><I><FONT
 COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">s Salaam Alaikum</FONT></I><FONT
 COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">
We have to add an </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">Alif</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial"> in front of the word </FONT><I><FONT
 COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">Salaam</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#000000"
 FACE="Arial">. This is a reminder, that we should lead our lives
as in the presence of Allah. In heaven, we will be aware of the
presence of Allah. We do not need a reminder then. The numerical
value of </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">Alif</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial"> is one. Adding one to the verse
number 58 we arrive at 59. We have to be present before Allah
at all times. Therefore the reply to our Rabb on that day is:</FONT></B></P>
