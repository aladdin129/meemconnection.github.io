<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Allah is Al Qawee, the
Strong. Strength is based on firmness. We looked at Al Mateen,
the Firm in the previous section. Now let us look at an example
of Al Qawee from the Quran:<BR>
</FONT></B></P>

<P><CENTER><B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">51</FONT><FONT COLOR="#009900" FACE="Arial"> &quot;This is for that which your
own hands have sent forth, and that Allah is never unjust to His
servants.<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">52</FONT><FONT COLOR="#009900" FACE="Arial"> &quot;After the manner of the people of Pharaoh
and of those before them; they rejected the signs of Allah and
Allah punished them for their crimes. Allah is Strong and strict
in punishment:</FONT></I></B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">[Quran: Al
Anfal, Chapter 8]</FONT></I></B></CENTER></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Allah is never unjust.
Each person in every community gets what they deserve. The example
given in the above reference is the people of the Pharaoh. What
did the Pharaoh and his people do? They rejected the signs of
Allah. They oppressed another race. Today we see exactly the same
situation across the world, where one race is oppressing another.
The oppression is based on greed and power over others because
of the strength of one race over another. Allah's Strength cannot
be overcome by anyone. Sooner or later the oppressors pay or will
pay for their actions. Allah is Strong and strict in punishment.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">In the case of Pharaoh
and his people, Allah caused a drought, shortness of crop, floods,
sent locusts, lice and frogs. Allah killed the first born son
of the Pharaoh and his community, just like the Pharaoh had killed
the sons of the Jews. Similarly when Abrah came to destroy the
First House in Makkah, Allah sent tiny birds to destroy Abrah
and his army.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Moving to the present
day, America and Britain bombed Iraq so that they could show their
strength, Allah sent 'foot and mouth' disease and infected the
livestock in Britain, where numerous livestock was destroyed.
America and Canada started suffering from &quot;power failures&quot;!
The people, that is, the scientists or analysts can look at all
kinds of excuses for the above 'misfortune'. But Allah tells us
plainly <I>&quot;This is for that which your own hands have sent
forth, and that Allah is never unjust to His servants.&quot;</I></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">But why is Iraq suffering?
The Iraqis first started fighting with Iranians. Then after that
did not get them very far, they picked on Kuwaitis. <I>&quot;This
is for that which your own hands have sent forth, and that Allah
is never unjust to His servants.&quot;</I></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">There is a lesson in
this for each one of us. We must constantly check ourselves. Each
one of us must realise, that we human beings are weak creatures.
It is Allah who is the Strong One. The strength given to us by
Allah is for our own self-defence. Allah gives us physical strength
for our physical protection. Allah gives us spiritual strength
for our spiritual protection. We must not and should not oppress
anyone with injustice, because Allah is Just, Strong and strict
in punishment. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Let us look at one more
example of Al Qawee from the Quran:<BR>
</FONT></B></P>

<P><CENTER><B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">64</FONT><FONT COLOR="#009900" FACE="Arial"> &quot;And my people! This she-camel
of Allah is a symbol to you: leave her to feed on Allah's earth
and inflict no harm on her or a swift penalty will seize you!

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">65</FONT><FONT COLOR="#009900" FACE="Arial"> But they did slew her. So he said: &quot;Enjoy
yourselves in your homes for three days! The promise cannot be
disproved!&quot; <BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">66</FONT><FONT COLOR="#009900" FACE="Arial"> When Our commandment came, We saved Saleh, and
those who believed with him, by a mercy from Us, from the ignominy
of that day. Your Rabb (Lord)! He is the Strong, the Mighty.</FONT></I></B></CENTER></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Because the mercy and
