Ya <IMG SRC="Images/10.gif" WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="23" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">is equivalent to the letter &#145;Y'
in the English alphabet. It is the last letter in the Arabic character
set. Its position is 28. Ya in Arabic numerology which is known
as Abjad, has the value of 10. This article is about the spiritual
meaning of the letter Ya.</FONT></EM></B></P>

<H3><CENTER><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+2">INTRODUCTION</FONT></STRONG></CENTER></H3>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">The letter Ya is the
18th letter in the verse Bismillah (shown at the top of this page).
There is no Arabic letter after Ya. The letter Ya completes the
Arabic letter set. It is the 28th and final letter. In the Abjad
format, the letter Ya is given the value 10.</FONT></B></P>

<H3><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+2">THE LETTER YA</FONT></CENTER></H3>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">The letter Ya is one
of the letters of </FONT><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">Muqattaat</FONT></I><FONT
 COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">. That is, it is used in the opening
verses of certain chapters in the Quran. Since there are only
19 letters in the verse Bismillah, the position of the letter
Ya had to be placed sensibly in the verse Bismillah. The letter
Ya is the 28th letter in the normal Arabic letter set. In the
Abjad format, it is 10th letter with the numerical value of 10.
The position of the letter Ya in the verse Bismillah is 18. This
is arrived at by subtracting the Abjad position from the normal
position: 28 - 10 = 18 giving the position in the verse Bismillah.<BR>
The letter Ya represents knowledge.</FONT></B></P>

<H3><CENTER><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+2">HOW DOES YA
REPRESENT KNOWLEDGE ?</FONT></STRONG></CENTER></H3>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">We start learning the
Arabic letters from Alif, Ba, Ta .. Etc. We complete this learning
stage when we get to the letter Ya. At this stage we have learnt
to recognise the physical appearance of all the Arabic letters
in their different shapes. For example, <IMG SRC="Images/4xYa.gif"
WIDTH="89" HEIGHT="28" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">
all four characters represent the same letter Ya in different
shapes. Therefore, after having learnt to recognise the letters
in their different forms, we can now start learning the words.
Since all the words in the Quran are formed by the combination
of the Arabic letters. The Arabic words will only be recognised
by a person who has first learnt to recognise the Arabic letters.
Having learnt all the Arabic letters, from Alif <IMG SRC="Images/1.gif"
WIDTH="9" HEIGHT="25" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">to
Ya <IMG SRC="Images/10.gif" WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="23" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">represents knowledge. Hence the
letter Ya represents completion of knowledge of the Arabic letters.</FONT></B></P>

<H3><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+2">WHAT COMES AFTER THE
LETTER YA ?</FONT></CENTER></H3>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">When we get to the last
letter in the Arabic character set, we have only learned to recognise
the letters. To use the letters we must wrap round back to the
first letter which is Alif <IMG SRC="Images/1.gif" WIDTH="9" 
HEIGHT="25" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">. We
need to start again. That is exactly what happens when we finish
reading the last Chapter 114 An Nas of the Quran we start again
from the beginning, Chapter 1 -Al Fatihah. Or, if reciting in
Salah, Chapter 1 (Al Fatihah) has a special place. It is always
recited first in every Rakah of the Salah. After Al Fatihah we
recite any part of the Quran in the first Rakah. In the subsequent
Rakahs, after Al Fatihah, we can either recite the same portion
from the Quran, or we must recite a portion that is placed after
the portion that was recited in the previous Rakah of the same
Salah. If for example we recited Chapter 112 &amp; 113 (Al Ikhlas
and Al Falaq) in the first Rakah, in the second Rakah, we can
either recite the same chapters again, OR, in the second Rakah
we can recite Chapter 114 (An Nas) followed by a few verses from
Chapter 2 - Al Baqara, starting at Alif Laam Meem. What we have
effectively done is come full circle.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">This is normally obvious
in the Tarawee Salah in the month of Ramadan. The Imam finishes
the recitation of the whole Quran in the Tarawee during the month
of Ramadan. At the completion after reciting Chapter 114, the
Imam recites a few lines from Chapter 2 Al Baqara starting at
verse 1. He goes back to the start, or the beginning.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">The letter that comes
after the letter Ya <IMG SRC="Images/10.gif" WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="23"

We start again from the beginning. Except, this time round we
have become a little wiser in recognising the letters. How can
the letter Alif follow the letter Ya?</FONT></B></P>

BACK TO ALIF ?</FONT></STRONG></CENTER></H3>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Of course it does! When
we gain some wisdom, we realise that there is One Supreme Being

modern English translations. Is that done subconsciously? The
letter O is a circle. It wraps round endlessly. Likewise, so is

Therefore the two people in the Quran are different from the two
people in the Bible. To put it bluntly, the name Maryam is not
the same as the name Mary. This creates a problem for the Muslims.
How can the Muslims answer the Christians? There is a simple answer.
Allah in His wisdom named Chapter 19 Maryam so that we would reflect
on it and eventually answer back to the Christians.</FONT></B></P>

the first three letters from the name Maryam and then separated
the fourth letter from the first three letters. Effectively, we

Allah did not just tell us about the noble lady Mary (<IMG SRC="Images/Hamza.gif"

Abu Daud, Nasai, Ibn Majah and Tabarani have related on the authority
of Hadrat Maqil bin Yasar that the Messenger of Allah said: &quot;Surah
Ya Seen is the heart of the Quran.&quot; This is similar to describing
the Surah Al Fatihah as the Umm al Quran (the essence or core
of the Quran), because Al Fatihah contains the sum and substance
of the teaching of the whole Quran. The Surah Ya Seen has been
called the throbbing heart of the Quran because it presents the
message of the Quran in a most forceful manner, which breaks the
inertness and stirs the spirit of man to action.</FONT></I></B></CENTER></P>

<I>Bismillah Hir Rahman Nir Raheem</I>.</FONT></B></P>

the end of the verse Bismillah in position 18. The letter Seen
is the second letter from the start of verse Bismillah. Just like
the word YA <IMG SRC="Images/YaAlif.gif" WIDTH="28" HEIGHT="33"
ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">, in Ya Seen the
later letter (Seen - in Bismillah) is mentioned first and the
earlier letter (Ya - in Bismillah) is mentioned last. Again we
are made to look at the endless circle. Chapter 36 could have
started with the letters Seen Ya, but then the circular concept
would have eluded us. The circular concept can also be understood
from the verses of Ya Seen, chapter 36 in the Quran.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">First, Allah creates
us. Then Allah gives us the faculties of learning to read, write

(<IMG SRC="Images/Hamza.gif" WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM"

communities the correct path to Allah. The communities that rebelled,
were destroyed by Allah. Allah then placed other communities in
their place. The circle of re-creation of communities.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Next, there are examples
of giving life to the dead earth. Followed by water flowing from
the earth. Producing vegetation from the soil to feed the creation.
The cycle of night and day which are again concepts of circles.
Followed by the mention of orbits of the sun and moon. The moon
has further stages in its orbit, whereas the sun is always seen
as circular ball. Then there is the human life which is for a
purpose. The human is created from nothing and this life is followed
by death. A second creation takes place at the end of time to
start another life which will be endless. And how does Allah do
all this? He commands &quot;Be&quot; and it is!</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">From the circular concept
we have just been dealing with, we can go one stage further. If
we transpose, as in rotate cyclically, the 18th position of the
letter Ya in the verse Bismillah we get 81. The transposed position
of the letter Seen in the verse Bismillah is still 2. Add 81 to
2 = 83. The total number of the verses in chapter 36 Ya Seen is
83.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">If we now reduce the
total number of verses we get 8 + 3 = 11 which is the same as
the word YA <IMG SRC="Images/YaAlif.gif" WIDTH="28" HEIGHT="33"
ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> which we say to
get someone's attention. Reduce this number to single digit 1
+ 1 = 2 which is the letter Ba (<IMG SRC="Images/2.gif" WIDTH="26"
HEIGHT="20" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> ).
The knowledge ( <IMG SRC="Images/10.gif" WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="23"

creature who has been created from a drop or dot. This knowledge
is guidance from Allah to us. This knowledge is our inheritance
from Allah through the Prophet Muhammad <IMG SRC="Images/saws.gif"

in the form of the Quran.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">If we add the position

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">18 + 2 = 20.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial"><BR>
If we subtract the position of letter Seen from the position of
letter Ya in the verse Bismillah we get 18 - 2 = 16.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Now adding the above
two results, 20 + 16 = 36 leads us back the Chapter 36 which is
Ya Seen.</FONT></B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+2">WHY IS CHAPTER 36
HEART OF THE QURAN ?</FONT></CENTER></H3>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Again we have to look
at the number 36 and arrive at the last number (3 + 6 =) 9. The
number 9 is the last number after which we wrap back to the first
number 1 (10 = 1 + 0 = 1).</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">The two chapters that
have the letter Ya as one of the initials in the opening verse
of the Quran are 19 and 36. If we add the number of the chapters
we still arrive at the numerical value of letter Ya:</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">19 + 36 = 55 = 5 + 5
= 10 = <IMG SRC="Images/10.gif" WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="23" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">In chapter 19 the letter
Ya was placed in the core or the centre of the five letters of
<I>Muqattaat</I>. We could say, the letter Ya was surrounded by
other letters, two on each side. In chapter 36, the letter Ya
is placed as the first letter to make it manifest.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Ya Seen, chapter 36 is
the heart of the Quran. If we divide the chapter number (36) with
the total number of chapters in the Quran (114), 36 divided by
114 = 0.3 approximately.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Or to put it another
way it is approximately one third (1/3). If we look at the human
body as one unit, the heart of a human being is also placed approximately
one third of the way down from the head. That is the physical
aspect of the chapter Ya Seen being the heart of the Quran.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">The spiritual aspect
is the content or the message of chapter 36. The message about
creation, resurrection, (re-creation on the day of judgement).
The cycles of vegetation. The mention of the four elements fire,
air, water and soil. The orbits of the sun and moon. The different
stages of the moon which can be interpreted as the different stages
of human life. Overall, everything mentioned in the chapter has
an effect on the human life. We can only experience these things
if we have been created. Just like the human life can only be
experienced as long as the heart is beating. As soon as it stops,
all these experiences cease and the reality of our deeds dawns
on us.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Alternatively, in the
Abjad numerical system, the position of the letter Ya is 10th
out of 28. Again 10 divided by 28 = 0.3 approximately. We could
say that the letter Ya is the heart of the Abjad numerical system.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">In the previous section
we have seen how Ya Seen leads us to the verse Bismillah. And
from the verse Bismillah, we are led back to Ya Seen. The analogy
would be like the heart pumping blood to the body, and the body
returning the blood back to the heart. Where Ya Seen is the heart
and Bismillah is the body. The entire Quran is represented by
and contained within the one verse which is Bismillah Hir Rahman
Nir Raheem.</FONT></B></P>
