OF HADRAT ABDUL QADIR AL JILANI (<IMG SRC="Images/200.gif" WIDTH="20"

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Did you know...</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Certain Awliya Allah
are sent to earth in human form more than once. They take on many
different bodies over the years. That is they are sent back as
new born babies and they start their earthly lifes all over again
as different people. If you do not believe me then read Hadrat
Sultan Bahu's books and he mentions almost in every one of his
books, that he saw Hadrat Fatima (<IMG SRC="Images/200.gif" WIDTH="20"
HEIGHT="19" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">) and
she called him her son. He further states that Hadrat Fatima (<IMG 
SRC="Images/200.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="19" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">) hugged him. A noble lady like Hadrat Fatima
(<IMG SRC="Images/200.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="19" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">) would never approach any man
outside the family. Least of all, she would never hug a strange
man no matter how pious, unless that man was her son. Therefore
what Hadrat Sultan Bahu (<IMG SRC="Images/200.gif" WIDTH="20"
HEIGHT="19" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">) is
trying to tell us is that his spirit was that of one of Hadrat
Fatima's sons (<IMG SRC="Images/200.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="19"
ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">).</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Similarly, Ghauss al
Azam, Hadrat Abdul Qadir al Jilani (<IMG SRC="Images/200.gif"
WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="19" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">)
has come to this world at different times taking on different
lifes. His real secret is that his spirit is that of Qasim bin
Muhammad (saws). I know this for a fact, because I heard this
secret from his own noble mouth. I learnt the basics about spirituality
from none other than Hadrat Abdul Qadir al Jilani (<IMG SRC="Images/200.gif"
WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="19" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">).
Ask any present day Awliya Allah, if you can find one, they will
neither confirm this in order to preserve the secret, nor will
they deny it, otherwise they will be lying. Hence all spiritual
paths converge to the Qadriya path. Hence the limit of the other
paths is only the starting point of the Qadriya path.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Therefore when Hadrat
Abdul Qadir Jilani (<IMG SRC="Images/200.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="19"
ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">) said &quot;My
foot is on the neck of all the Awliya Allah&quot;, not a single
Awliya Allah refuted. Why ?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Because they knew who
he was in reality. The 'son' of Muhammad bin Abdullah <IMG SRC="Images/saws.gif"
WIDTH="25" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">.
The spirit of Qasim bin Muhammad. Although Allah took the lives
of our Master Muhammad's <IMG SRC="Images/saws.gif" WIDTH="25"
HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> sons
during the earthly life of Muhammad <IMG SRC="Images/saws.gif"
WIDTH="25" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">
in order to stop the line of Messengers and make our Master as
Khatamun Nabee <IMG SRC="Images/saws.gif" WIDTH="25" HEIGHT="24"
ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">- the Seal of Messengers
. Allah in His Mercy sends the spirits of Muhammad's <IMG SRC="Images/saws.gif"
WIDTH="25" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">
sons again and again after every 100 years to revive Islam. Therefore
every 100 years Allah sends one person who restores Islam to it's
true state, and purges the corruption that creeps into Islam over
the past century.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Talking of spirits or
RUH, Allah promises us HOORs in paradise.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Look at the word RUH
<IMG SRC="Images/8.gif" WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="25" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><IMG SRC="Images/6.gif" WIDTH="20"
HEIGHT="20" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><IMG 
SRC="Images/200.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="19" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> which is spelt Ra Waw Ha in ARABIC.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Look at the word HOOR
<IMG SRC="Images/200.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="19" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><IMG SRC="Images/6.gif" WIDTH="20"
HEIGHT="20" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><IMG

NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> which is spelt Ha Waw Ra in ARABIC.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">A HOOR is RUH spelt backwards.
Now can you see why and how these Awliya Allah are sent back?
Those who are disbelievers get trapped. They cannot return.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">If there is any doubt
in the reader's mind that what I have stated is not true, then
ask any Awliya Allah (not todays scholars) to deny any part of
what I have stated if they are truthful. The scholars of this
day and age cannot see or understand beyond the words. Allah is
a Witness to this fact.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Alternatively, read Darood
1111 times and ask Allah to confirm the above. There can be no
doubt after that.</FONT></B></P>
