<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">As Saboor means The Patient.
The first lesson in spiritual enlightenment is to learn patience.
This has been revealed in the Quran in countless places. Let us
look at an example from the Quran:</FONT></B></P>

<P><CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial"><IMG SRC="Images/Ch18_67.gif" WIDTH="274" HEIGHT="53" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>

with me! <BR>
[Quran: Al Kahf Chapter 18]</FONT></I></B></CENTER></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">This incidence took place,
when Musa (<IMG SRC="Images/Hamza.gif" WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">) met Khidr (<IMG SRC="Images/Hamza.gif" WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">). Even after having spoken to
Allah, Musa (<IMG SRC="Images/Hamza.gif" WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">) was still in need
of a lesson in patience. If Musa (<IMG SRC="Images/Hamza.gif" WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">),
even with the honour of being Allah's Messenger, needed a lesson
in patience, then we, the ordinary people, are in an even a greater
need of learning patience. <BR>
In nature, Allah has given us another example. We have all heard
the expression that a dog is man's best friend. If we do not feed
the dog for a day or more, the dog will still respect its master.
The dog will not bite its master because of starvation. The dog
will not turn against its master. If we admonish the dog for a
wrong action, the dog will still respect its master. It will not
bark at the master.<BR>
If we are deprived of a single meal, we turn against our Master
who is our Rabb (Lord). We become impatient. We can learn a lesson
from the dog. If a dog is faithful to its master, then what is
wrong with the human beings that we become unfaithful to our Master?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">The first lesson we all
need to learn is Sabr. Why? Because Allah is As Saboor - The Patient
One and we also have to emulate the quality of being patient.<BR>
There are many instances in which patience is required. We need
to be patient when we are hungry. We need to be patient when we
are in pain. We need to be patient when we are ill. We need to
be patient when we suffer a loss. Whatever the reason for distress,
we need to be patient. Patience is a noble quality.<BR>
When we transgress against Allah, Allah is patient with us. Perhaps
we might turn back and ask for forgiveness. Allah gives us plenty
of chances to repent or turn back to the right path so that we
can ask Allah for forgiveness. Allah does not like haste. Haste
is a quality of Shaytan (Satan). Shaytan makes us act in haste.</FONT></B></P>

[Quran: Al Baqara, Chapter 2]</FONT></I></B></CENTER></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">From the above reference,
in verse 45 we learn that patience can only be achieved by humbling
ourselves. And the verse that follows clearly states that: Who
know that they will have to meet their Rabb and to Him they are
returning. This is what we are trying to achieve with this book,
we know we have to meet our Rabb and we have to return to Him.
<BR>
There are two ways of returning to our Rabb. One way is through
death when we leave the world physically. The other way is to
die before death. That is to kill the worldly desires.</FONT></B></P>

<P><CENTER><B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">Abu Bakr came
from his house at As-Sunh on a horse. He dismounted and entered
the masjid, but did not speak to the people till he entered at
Aisha's and went straight to Allah's Rasool who was covered with
Hibra cloth. He then uncovered the Prophet's face and bowed over
him and kissed him and wept, saying, &quot;Let my father and mother
be sacrificed for you. By Allah, Allah will never cause you to
die twice. As for the death which was written for you, has come
upon you.&quot;<BR>
[Sahih Bukhari]</FONT></I></B></CENTER></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">There is something very
interesting in the above Hadees. The last two sentences are very
important. </FONT><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">By Allah,
Allah will never cause you to die twice. As for the death which
was written for you, has come upon you.</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">&#133;never cause
you to die twice.</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">
Why did Abu Bakr as Siddiq (<IMG SRC="Images/200.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="19" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">) say
those words? What he meant was that no person can experience death
twice. What he indicated was that Muhammad <IMG SRC="Images/saws.gif" WIDTH="25" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">
had already given up worldly desires while he was walking on this
earth in a physical form. What he indicated was that Muhammad
<IMG SRC="Images/saws.gif" WIDTH="25" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> had already experienced death
before death came. What Abu Bakr as Siddiq (<IMG SRC="Images/200.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="19" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">)
indicated was that Muhammad <IMG SRC="Images/saws.gif" WIDTH="25" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> had
already met Allah while he was still walking on this earth. And
nobody can meet Allah before death, unless of course we die (or
kill our worldly desires) before death comes to us. Only then
can we meet Allah while we are still walking on this earth. The
last sentence in the above Hadees clarifies the normal death,
which is decreed by Allah even while we were in our mother's womb.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">To clarify the two deaths,
that is die before dying, is when we leave alone the worldly desires
and we are not attracted to them while we live amongst the people
of earth. The second death is where we depart from the earthly
community and live with the community of Burzakh, the spirit world.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">How do we achieve the
death before death? By practicing and achieving patience. When
we have patience. Then we are not bothered by hunger. Then we
are not bothered by insults. Then we are not bothered by possessions.
Then we are effectively dead to this world of illusions and we
are alive in Allah. That is when Shaytan can longer influence
us.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Adam (<IMG SRC="Images/Hamza.gif" WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">)
was driven out of heaven for one mistake and he had to learn to
be patient for 330 years. Then, and only then, was Adam (<IMG SRC="Images/Hamza.gif" WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">) admitted back to heaven into
the presence of Allah. The average human life span is much shorter
in the present age. Even then we are impatient. Therefore we should
start with the lesson on patience and work our way back to Allah.
That is, let us start by learning the most difficult lesson in
patience first and work our way back to Allah. Let us die before
death comes to us. Let us kill our desires for this world of illusions.
When we achieve that, we can return to Allah even while we walk
on this earth in a physical form.</FONT></B></P>
