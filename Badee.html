of everything. Allah is the originator of the heavens and earth
and everything within. If Allah did not exist, then there would
be no me, no you, no they and certainly no Shay - thing. In other

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Why bother with creation?
The answer is in the previous verse to the above reference which
is shown here:</FONT></B></P>

<P><CENTER><B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">116</FONT><FONT COLOR="#009900" FACE="Arial"> They say: &quot;Allah has begotten
a son&quot;; Glory be to Him. To Him belongs all that is in the
heavens and on earth; everything renders worship to Him. <BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">117</FONT><FONT COLOR="#009900" FACE="Arial"> The Originator of the heavens and the earth! When
He decrees a thing, He says to it only: &quot;Be!&quot; And it
is. <BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">118</FONT><FONT COLOR="#009900" FACE="Arial"> And those without knowledge say: &quot;Why does
Allah not speak to us, or a some sign come to us?&quot; So said
the people before them words of similar import.  Their hearts
are alike.  We have indeed made clear the signs to any people
who hold firmly to faith.</FONT></I></B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">[Quran: Al
Baqara Chapter 2]</FONT></I></B></CENTER></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Every creation has been
created to worship Allah. Every creation worships Allah in its
own way. Only we do not 'see' how these different creations worship
Allah. <BR>
For example, the sun, the moon the earth and all the planets have
been created to worship Allah. How? The planets have been created
to orbit the sun. The sun has been created to provide sunlight
to the planets. The sun does not extinguish of its own free will.
The planets do not stop in their orbits of their own free will.
Each one is obeying the command of Allah. The angels are created
out of light. They obey Allah. <BR>
The jinn are created from smokeless fire.  And the humans are
created from clay. Both the jinn and human have been created to
worship Allah. But we rebel! Why? Because the jinn and the human
are susceptible to Shaytan. We fall into the traps set by Shaytan.
<BR>
In the above reference from the Quran we find the mention of the
false and baseless association of a son to Allah. </FONT><I><FONT COLOR="#009900" FACE="Arial">They say: &quot;Allah has begotten
a son&quot;; Glory be to Him. To Him belongs all that is in the
heavens and on earth; everything renders worship to Him.</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">There is simple solution
to this argument. How can a Creator who is not created be physically
related to a creation? The two cannot be related. Then we are
told that everything in heavens and earth belong to him. In other
words everything in heavens and earth are Allah's creation. We
all belong to him in the sense that Allah is our Creator. Allah
is not limited in any way, but all creation is a limitation. Even
the heavens and earth are limited. So are we.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">There is another form
of beauty in the above quote from the Quran. We cannot observe
the heavens and earth without being created. If we did not come
into existence we would not experience the creation. Finally here
is another reference from the Quran:<BR>
</FONT></B></P>

<P><CENTER><B><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial"><IMG SRC="Images/Ch6_101.gif" WIDTH="417" HEIGHT="84" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">101 </FONT><FONT COLOR="#009900" FACE="Arial">The Originator of the heavens and the earth! How
can He have a child, when there is for Him no associate, when
He created all things and is Aware of all things?</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial"></FONT></I></B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">[Quran: Al
Anaam, Chapter 6]<BR>
</FONT></I></B></CENTER></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Allah brings the creation
<IMG SRC="Images/2.gif" WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="20" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">  into existence within the constraints
of Dairah<IMG SRC="Images/4.gif" WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> - a circle or limitation with
His Knowledge <IMG SRC="Images/10.gif" WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="23" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> . Why are we here?
Believe it or not, we are here to seek knowledge. Only by being
created can we gather knowledge that will be useful for us in
the next world. From a thought form the creation becomes Ayn <IMG SRC="Images/70.gif" WIDTH="27" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> visible when the command is given by Allah
&quot;Be!&quot; In our case we have to associate the knowledge
we gather with what we see in this world. As it was stated in
Ayn al Miftah, for every visible thing in this world, there is
a hidden or spiritual meaning. We can only understand the spiritual
side if we use our knowledge to discern or observe what we see.
Seeing without knowledge is of no use. Knowledge without seeing
is also of no use. We have to associate the knowledge with what
we see.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">A good example is when
we go to school we are taught to conduct experiments in physics,
chemistry or biology. We observe the outcome and then we make
conclusions on what we have observed. Similarly, we must be observant
every waking hour and minute. We must try and understand whatever
we see. We must try and understand what is the reality behind
what we are observing. With observation we will understand something
about the creation and hopefully advance in knowledge, Insha Allah.
</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">There is another subtle
point that needs to be mentioned here. If Allah did not create
us we would not be here. If we were not here, then we would not
have the opportunity to observe either the heavens or the earth.
Neither would we be able to gain knowledge. As far as associating
knowledge with observation or observation with knowledge is concerned
that would also be nonexistent. It is a sad fact that the majority
of the people having been given the chance to exist by Allah,
fail to observe and gain knowledge. May Allah, the Originator
of the heavens and earth teach us some of the knowledge of whatever
we observe. Ameen. <BR>
