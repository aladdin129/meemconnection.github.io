<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Here are two Quotations.
One from the Quran and the other from Hadees. Remember these two
Quotes, they will be referred to later in this text.</FONT></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#009900" FACE="Arial">Say (unto them):
If the abode of the Hereafter with Allah is indeed for you alone
and not for others of mankind (as you pretend), then long for
death (for you must long for death) if you are truthful.</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#009900" FACE="Arial">[QURAN: AL BAQARA
Chapter 2]</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#009900" FACE="Arial">Rasool Allah said,
&quot;At every womb Allah appoints an angel who says, 'O Lord!
A drop of semen, O Lord! A clot. O Lord! A little lump of flesh.&quot;
Then if Allah wishes (to complete) its creation, the angel asks,
(O Lord!) Will it be a male or female, a wretched or a blessed,
and how much will his provision be? And what will his age be?'
So all that is written while the child is still in the mother's
womb.&quot;</FONT></CENTER></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">&gt; Dear Muslim Brothers
and Sisters:<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Assalamu Alaikum<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; This is a letter from Saudi Arabia and addressed to all the
Muslims.<BR>
&gt; These are the words of Sheik Ahmed, the watchman of the Prophet<BR>
&gt; Muhammad's mosque (PBUH). On Friday night after reciting
the Holy Quran,<BR>
&gt; Sheik Ahmed slept and saw the Holy Prophet (PBUH) in his
dream. The<BR>
&gt; Prophet (PBUH) said to him, &quot;Sheik Ahmed, this Friday
about six thousand<BR>
&gt; (6,000) people died, but none of them went to heaven. The
women do not<BR>
&gt; follow what their husbands tell them anymore. The believers
who have<BR>
&gt; money do not help the poor. People do not perform their pilgrimage
as it<BR>
&gt; is prescribed. The Muslims do not say their prayers regularly,
let alone<BR>
&gt; how it is supposed to be.&quot; Sheik Ahmed, tell the Muslims
that this<BR>
&gt; letter comes from you. They are to produce more copies of
this letter<BR>
&gt; and give to other Muslims so that it can spread and get to
all the<BR>
&gt; Muslims in this world. Anyone who produces this and spreads
it to other<BR>
&gt; Muslims will see it indeed (will see the REWARD). The Prophet
(PBUH)<BR>
&gt; will count such a person to Paradise along with his children.
The Muslim<BR>
&gt; who receives this letter and refuses to disperse it among
other Muslims<BR>
&gt; will not see benediction (INSHALLAH). Those who are indebted
must write.<BR>
&gt; Allah in his infinite mercies will send help to pay his debt.
I, Sheik<BR>
&gt; Ahmed, if what I said is a lie, may the Prophet (PBUH) not
send his<BR>
&gt; divine benediction to me.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Dear Muslim brothers and sisters, you must follow the religion
the way<BR>
&gt; the Prophet (PBUH) honored it, like the divine revelation
it is. Ask for<BR>
&gt; forgiveness, fast every Monday. Produce twenty (20) copies
of this<BR>
&gt; letter and spread it to all Muslims. Anyone who does this
until all<BR>
&gt; Muslims get a copy, will INSHALLAH, see the opening of the
Prophet's<BR>
&gt; (PBUH) desires and success will follow. He will see the things
he had<BR>
&gt; never seen before. This is not a letter to be kept. It must
be dispersed<BR>
&gt; in large quantities.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; * A man called Klavern, got this letter and gave it to his
secretary to<BR>
&gt; produce twenty (20) copies and disperse them. After some
days, he saw<BR>
&gt; many doors of opportunities opening up for him.<BR>
&gt; * Another person named Abdul-Salam got it and forgot it in
the drawer of<BR>
&gt; his office, and after a certain time he lost his job. He
later<BR>
&gt; remembered the letter and went and produced twenty (20) copies
which<BR>
&gt; were distributed and within five (5) days he got employed
and is in a<BR>
&gt; higher position than what he had before.<BR>
&gt; * Another man called Balemanthan received it and he thought
it was<BR>
&gt; something useless and treated it without respect or courtesy.
He tore<BR>
&gt; the letter and within nine (9) days he died.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I am appealing to anyone who comes across this letter to
kindly<BR>
&gt; circulate it in large volume.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Thanks. May Allah Bless You.<BR>
&gt; <BR>

<P><CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="AlgerianBasD">AUTHENTIC
OR FAKE ?</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">First of all, there is no
date in the contents of the letter. It gives no indication of
when it was written. We do not even know whether it is current
or old.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Let us start with the first
two sentences...</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">This is a letter from Saudi
Arabia and addressed to all the Muslims.<BR>
&gt; These are the words of Sheik Ahmed</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">The letter is from Saudi
Arabia.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Why is it in English
?</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Is the 'Sheik' an English
speaking person ?</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Notice there are no spelling
mistakes in the letter and the grammar is EXCELLENT for a 'Sheik'
who must have spent all his life in Madinah and never lived in
the West. All right, he may have a friend who can read and write
English and Arabic.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">I am living in England.
I have received it here via email.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Did the 'Sheik' not find
any Muslims in Madinah ?</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Did the 'Sheik' not find
any Muslims in Mecca ?</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Did the 'Sheik' not find
any Muslims in the Middle East ?</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Does that mean all the
Muslims now live in the West ?</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Notice the word Sheik SHEIK.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Does a Muslim write SHEIK
or does a Muslim write SHEIKH or SHAIKH ?</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">English speaking people
write SHEIK because they find it difficult to pronounce 'KH'.
And by the way, my name is KHALID! I should know!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Next few lines:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">&gt; <B>These are the words
of Sheik Ahmed</B>, the watchman of the Prophet<BR>
&gt; Muhammad's mosque (PBUH). On Friday night after reciting
the Holy Quran,<BR>
&gt; <B>Sheik Ahmed slept</B> and saw the Holy Prophet (PBUH)
in his dream.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">If these are the words
of 'Sheik', why is he writing the letter as a THIRD person:</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">&quot;SHEIK AHMED SLEPT
! &quot; ?</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Why did he not write
I SLEPT ?</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Is it because the 'SHEIK'
did not write these words ?</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Moving quickly along....</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">&gt;Sheik Ahmed, tell the
Muslims that this<BR>
&gt; letter comes from you. They are to produce more copies of
this letter<BR>
&gt; and give to other Muslims so that it can spread and get to
all the<BR>
&gt; Muslims in this world. Anyone who produces this and spreads
it to other<BR>
&gt; Muslims will see it indeed (will see the REWARD).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">In the above section we
are supposed to produce more copies of this letter and give to
other Muslims. The last sentence says it all!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Anyone who produces this,
spreads it, will be rewarded.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Will they be rewarded
?</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Never mind prayer. Never
mind feeding the poor. Never mind pilgrimage. Just spread copies
of the letter. GET REAL! WAKE UP!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Last sentence along with
the Next sentence:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">&gt;Anyone who produces
this and spreads it to other<BR>
&gt; Muslims will see it indeed (will see the REWARD).The Prophet
(PBUH) will count &gt;such a person to Paradise along with his
children.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Does this mean, if anyone
makes copies of this letter and spreads the copies to others,
they and their children are guaranteed Paradise ?</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Does this mean, if anyone
makes copies of this letter and spreads the copies to others,
they and their children do not need to say the prayer, or feed
the poor, or do pilgrimage because they are guaranteed Paradise
?</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Does this mean, if anyone
makes copies of this letter and spreads the copies to others,
they and their children can do whatever they like because they
are guaranteed Paradise ?</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Moving right along:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">&gt; * A man called Klavern,
got this letter and gave it to his secretary to<BR>
&gt; produce twenty (20) copies and disperse them. After some
days, he saw<BR>
&gt; many doors of opportunities opening up for him.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Klavern - Is that an
Islamic name ?</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">When he gave it to his secretary,
who produced 20 copies, dispersed the letter, opportunities opened
up for him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Not through prayer. Oh NO!
Not through feeding the poor. Oh NO! Not by performing pilgrimage.
Oh NO! BY MAKING 20 COPIES OF THE LETTERS AND DISPERSING THEM
many doors opened up for him. WOW!</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">My brothers and sisters
in Islam are we doing something wrong by praying, feeding the
poor, or performing pilgrimage ?</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Should we be making 20
COPIES of the letter and dispersing them ?</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">The question that begs to
be asked:</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">How did Klavern's turn
in fortunes get included in the letter ?</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Did Klavern write to the
'SHEIK' :</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">Dear Sheik</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">I asked my secretary to
make 20 copies of your letter. Many doors of opportunities opened
up for me. On your next revision of the letter, you have my permission
to include my story.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">yours sincerely</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">Klavern</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">P.S. Thanks for sending
the letter in the first place.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">How else would Klavern's
story get included in the letter ?</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Next Person in the letter:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">&gt; * Another person named
Abdul-Salam got it and forgot it in the drawer of<BR>
&gt; his office, and after a certain time he lost his job. He
later<BR>
&gt; remembered the letter and went and produced twenty (20) copies
which<BR>
&gt; were distributed and within five (5) days he got employed
and is in a<BR>
&gt; higher position than what he had before.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Abdul-Salam, at last, a
good wholesome Islamic name. Being a Muslim he did not care about
this letter. Poor guy got the sack. Then he remembered the letter
and made 20 COPIES. He did well. Not through prayer. Not through
helping the poor. Not by performing the Pilgrimage. Oh NO! Easy,
20 COPIES of the letter, and he is doing better than before.</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Again the question begs
to be asked, how did his story get on the letter?</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Did he also write to
the Sheik and tell him to include his story in the next reprint
of the letter ?</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">The Final Person:</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">&gt; * Another man called
Balemanthan received it and he thought it was<BR>
&gt; something useless and treated it without respect or courtesy.
He tore<BR>
&gt; the letter and within nine (9) days he died.<BR>
&gt;</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Balemanthan - Is that
an Islamic name ?</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">This unfortunate person
DIED. He did not take the easy option of making 20 COPIES and
distributing them. He certainly paid for it. He must have been
stupid!</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial">Wait a minute!
If this last person died, how did his story get included in the
letter ?</FONT></I></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Did the Sheik see him
in a dream ?</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">And FINALLY the last sentence
in the letter:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" FACE="Arial">&gt; I am appealing to anyone
who comes across this letter to kindly<BR>
&gt; circulate it in large volume.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">THE MUSLIMS SHOULD WAKE
UP! There is no room for superstition in Islam. If death comes,
it is the Will of Allah. For a Muslim this life is a separation
from Allah. Death for a Muslim is to be in the presence of Allah.
READ the Quran and Hadees quoted at the top of this article. That
is our guidance. Nobody will die for breaking the chain of this
letter or any other chain letter that one comes across.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Someone out there is playing
a silly game with Muslims by sending this letter. Other Muslims
are following the instructions of making '20 COPIES' without even
thinking. You do not need a PHD to see that the letter is fabricated.
All you need is common sense. Allah has given a reasonable amount
of knowledge to every human being to know right from wrong. We
should use our brains more often.</FONT></P>

<P><CENTER><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">May Allah guide
ALL Muslims and lead them from darkness into <B>LIGHT</B>.</FONT></I></CENTER></P>
