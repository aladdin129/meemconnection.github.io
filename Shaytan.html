FATE ?</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">First of all who or what
is shaytan ? Look at the Arabic word and Shayteen and that is
the clue. SHAY is a &quot;THING&quot;. TEEN is what we humans
are made of, which is CLAY.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Therefore Shaytan is
a &quot;thing within the clay&quot;. It is part of the human constitution.
It is like a fire which keeps the body warm when alive. On death
Shaytan leaves and the lifeless body becomes cold. Therefore Shaytan
is only doing what it was supposed to do. To keep the blood flowing
in the body. Just like it is stated in a Hadees, Shaytan runs
in the human body like blood circulates. What does that mean ?
Exactly what it says. It flows as blood in the human body. Another
analogy of the human body is the planet earth. On the surfcae
it is cool or warm or hot. In the core of the Earth there is a
raging fire which we see erupting as volcanoes.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Ask any spiritual master
WHAT is Shaytan, the honest and true answer will be GHAIR ALLAH.
Ghair Allah means other than Allah. Now if we consider the verses
of the Quran and we are told time and time again, Whatever is
heaven and earth belongs to Allah. Whatever is in heaven and earth
declares the praises of Allah. Therefore we can safely deduce
that if everything in heaven and earth belongs to Allah, then
how can Shaytan exist ? And all the spiritual masters will agree
in there hearts that Shaytan is other than Allah, therefore it
does not exist. All the affectations of the heart are from Allah.
Whether good or evil. Hence the statements in the Quran to the
effect: He only guides whom He wants to. And He leaves others
to stray. Furthermore: It is your duty to pass the Message, it
is up to Us whom We wish to guide.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">So coming back to the
question SHAYTAN'S FATE ? The answer is nothing will happen to
Shaytan. How can Shaytan have a fate, if it does not exist? It
is other than Allah. The only existence is that of Allah. Hence
the utterance by Rasool Allah <IMG SRC="Images/saws.gif" WIDTH="25"
HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> &quot;I
saw Allah and there was nothing beside Him&quot; Hadrat Ali (<IMG 
SRC="Images/200.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="19" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">) confirmed &quot;This moment is that very
moment.&quot;</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" FACE="Arial">Allah is, as He was and
there is nothing beside Him.</FONT></B></P>
